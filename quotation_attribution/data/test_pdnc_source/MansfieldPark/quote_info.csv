Q1,"My dear Sir Thomas, I perfectly comprehend you, and do justice to the
generosity and delicacy of your notions, which indeed are quite of a
piece with your general conduct; and I entirely agree with you in the
main as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of
providing for a child one had in a manner taken into one's own hands;
and I am sure I should be the last person in the world to withhold my
mite upon such an occasion. Having no children of my own, who should I
look to in any little matter I may ever have to bestow, but the
children of my sisters?   and I am sure Mr. Norris is too just   but you
know I am a woman of few words and professions. Do not let us be
frightened from a good deed by a trifle. Give a girl an education, and
introduce her properly into the world, and ten to one but she has the
means of settling well, without farther expense to anybody. A niece of
ours, Sir Thomas, I may say, or at least of _yours_, would not grow up
in this neighbourhood without many advantages. I don't say she would be
so handsome as her cousins. I dare say she would not; but she would be
introduced into the society of this country under such very favourable
circumstances as, in all human probability, would get her a creditable
establishment. You are thinking of your sons   but do not you know that,
of all things upon earth, _that_ is the least likely to happen, brought
up as they would be, always together like brothers and sisters? It is
morally impossible. I never knew an instance of it. It is, in fact, the
only sure way of providing against the connexion. Suppose her a pretty
girl, and seen by Tom or Edmund for the first time seven years hence,
and I dare say there would be mischief. The very idea of her having
been suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty and
neglect, would be enough to make either of the dear, sweet-tempered
boys in love with her. But breed her up with them from this time, and
suppose her even to have the beauty of an angel, and she will never be
more to either than a sister.","[6235, 8290]",Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Sir Thomas']",Explicit,Mrs Norris interrupted him with a reply,"[['My dear Sir Thomas', 'you', 'your', 'your', 'you', 'my sisters', 'you', 'us', 'Sir Thomas', 'yours', 'she', 'her cousins', 'she', 'she', 'her', 'You', 'your sons', 'you', 'they', 'her', 'Tom', 'Edmund', 'her', 'us', 'the dear, sweet-tempered\nboys', 'her', 'her', 'them', 'her', 'she']]","[[[6235, 6253], [6278, 6281], [6332, 6336], [6385, 6389], [6433, 6436], [6796, 6806], [6853, 6856], [6916, 6918], [7140, 7150], [7179, 7184], [7264, 7267], [7292, 7303], [7316, 7319], [7335, 7338], [7473, 7476], [7505, 7508], [7525, 7534], [7548, 7551], [7641, 7645], [7835, 7838], [7866, 7869], [7873, 7879], [7975, 7978], [8030, 8032], [8095, 8124], [8138, 8141], [8153, 8156], [8165, 8169], [8198, 8201], [8243, 8246]]]","[[['Sir Thomas'], ['Sir Thomas'], ['Sir Thomas'], ['Sir Thomas'], ['Sir Thomas'], ['Mrs. Price', 'Lady Bertram'], ['Sir Thomas'], ['Lady Bertram', 'Sir Thomas', 'Mrs. Norris'], ['Sir Thomas'], ['Sir Thomas'], ['Fanny Price'], ['Maria Bertram', 'Julia Bertram'], ['Fanny Price'], ['Fanny Price'], ['Fanny Price'], ['Sir Thomas'], ['Tom Bertram', 'Edmund'], ['Sir Thomas'], ['Fanny Price', 'Edmund', 'Tom Bertram'], ['Fanny Price'], ['Tom Bertram'], ['Edmund'], ['Fanny Price'], ['Lady Bertram', 'Sir Thomas', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris'], ['Tom Bertram', 'Edmund'], ['Fanny Price'], ['Fanny Price'], ['Tom Bertram', 'Edmund'], ['Fanny Price'], ['Fanny Price']]]",F,,intermediate,,,,0,0,13,6235,8290

write to my poor sister tomorrow, and make the proposal; and, as soon
as matters are settled, _I_ will engage to get the child to Mansfield;

Q119,"And yet, in general, nothing can be more easily ascertained. The
distinction is so broad. Manners as well as appearance are, generally
speaking, so totally different. Till now, I could not have supposed it
possible to be mistaken as to a girl's being out or not. A girl not out
has always the same sort of dress: a close bonnet, for instance; looks
very demure, and never says a word. You may smile, but it is so, I
assure you; and except that it is sometimes carried a little too far,
it is all very proper. Girls should be quiet and modest. The most
objectionable part is, that the alteration of manners on being
introduced into company is frequently too sudden. They sometimes pass
in such very little time from reserve to quite the opposite   to
confidence! _That_ is the faulty part of the present system. One does
not like to see a girl of eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to
every thing   and perhaps when one has seen her hardly able to speak the

altered young lady. You paint too accurately for mistake. It was
exactly so. The Andersons of Baker Street. We were speaking of them the
other day, you know. Edmund, you have heard me mention Charles
Anderson. The circumstance was precisely as this lady has represented
it. When Anderson first introduced me to his family, about two years
ago, his sister was not _out_, and I could not get her to speak to me.
I sat there an hour one morning waiting for Anderson, with only her and
a little girl or two in the room, the governess being sick or run away,
and the mother in and out every moment with letters of business, and I
could hardly get a word or a look from the young lady   nothing like a
civil answer   she screwed up her mouth, and turned from me with such an
air! I did not see her again for a twelvemonth. She was then _out_. I
met her at Mrs. Holford's, and did not recollect her. She came up to
me, claimed me as an acquaintance, stared me out of countenance; and
talked and laughed till I did not know which way to look. I felt that I
must be the jest of the room at the time, and Miss Crawford, it is

September, just after my return from the West Indies. My friend
Sneyd   you have heard me speak of Sneyd, Edmund   his father, and mother,
and sisters, were there, all new to me. When we reached Albion Place
they were out; we went after them, and found them on the pier: Mrs. and
the two Miss Sneyds, with others of their acquaintance. I made my bow
in form; and as Mrs. Sneyd was surrounded by men, attached myself to
one of her daughters, walked by her side all the way home, and made
myself as agreeable as I could; the young lady perfectly easy in her
manners, and as ready to talk as to listen. I had not a suspicion that
I could be doing anything wrong. They looked just the same: both
well-dressed, with veils and parasols like other girls; but I
afterwards found that I had been giving all my attention to the
youngest, who was not _out_, and had most excessively offended the

Q139,"I am sure _you_
need not regard it. The expense need not be any impediment. If I were
you, I should not think of the expense. I would have everything done in
the best style, and made as nice as possible. Such a place as Sotherton
Court deserves everything that taste and money can do. You have space
to work upon there, and grounds that will well reward you. For my own
part, if I had anything within the fiftieth part of the size of
Sotherton, I should be always planting and improving, for naturally I
am excessively fond of it. It would be too ridiculous for me to attempt
anything where I am now, with my little half acre. It would be quite a
burlesque. But if I had more room, I should take a prodigious delight
in improving and planting. We did a vast deal in that way at the
Parsonage: we made it quite a different place from what it was when we
first had it. You young ones do not remember much about it, perhaps;
but if dear Sir Thomas were here, he could tell you what improvements
we made: and a great deal more would have been done, but for poor Mr.
Norris's sad state of health. He could hardly ever get out, poor man,
to enjoy anything, and _that_ disheartened me from doing several things
that Sir Thomas and I used to talk of. If it had not been for _that_,
we should have carried on the garden wall, and made the plantation to
shut out the churchyard, just as Dr. Grant has done. We were always
doing something as it was. It was only the spring twelvemonth before

kingdom. We do not look in great cities for our best morality. It is
not there that respectable people of any denomination can do most good;
and it certainly is not there that the influence of the clergy can be
most felt. A fine preacher is followed and admired; but it is not in
fine preaching only that a good clergyman will be useful in his parish
and his neighbourhood, where the parish and neighbourhood are of a size
capable of knowing his private character, and observing his general
conduct, which in London can rarely be the case. The clergy are lost
there in the crowds of their parishioners. They are known to the
largest part only as preachers. And with regard to their influencing
public manners, Miss Crawford must not misunderstand me, or suppose I
mean to call them the arbiters of good-breeding, the regulators of
refinement and courtesy, the masters of the ceremonies of life. The
_manners_ I speak of might rather be called _conduct_, perhaps, the
result of good principles; the effect, in short, of those doctrines
which it is their duty to teach and recommend; and it will, I believe,
be everywhere found, that as the clergy are, or are not what they ought

Q506-1,"If
every play is to be objected to, you will act nothing, and the
preparations will be all so much money thrown away, and I am sure
_that_ would be a discredit to us all. I do not know the play; but, as
Maria says, if there is anything a little too warm (and it is so with
most of them) it can be easily left out. We must not be over-precise,
Edmund. As Mr. Rushworth is to act too, there can be no harm. I only
wish Tom had known his own mind when the carpenters began, for there
was the loss of half a day's work about those side-doors. The curtain
will be a good job, however. The maids do their work very well, and I
think we shall be able to send back some dozens of the rings. There is
no occasion to put them so very close together. I _am_ of some use, I
hope, in preventing waste and making the most of things. There should
always be one steady head to superintend so many young ones. I forgot
to tell Tom of something that happened to me this very day. I had been
looking about me in the poultry-yard, and was just coming out, when who
should I see but Dick Jackson making up to the servants' hall-door with
two bits of deal board in his hand, bringing them to father, you may be
sure; mother had chanced to send him of a message to father, and then
father had bid him bring up them two bits of board, for he could not no
how do without them. I knew what all this meant, for the servants'
dinner-bell was ringing at the very moment over our heads; and as I
hate such encroaching people (the Jacksons are very encroaching, I have
always said so: just the sort of people to get all they can), I said to
the boy directly (a great lubberly fellow of ten years old, you know,
who ought to be ashamed of himself),    _I'll_ take the boards to your
father, Dick, so get you home again as fast as you can.' The boy looked
very silly, and turned away without offering a word, for I believe I
might speak pretty sharp; and I dare say it will cure him of coming
marauding about the house for one while. I hate such greediness   so good
as your father is to the family, employing the man all the year round!","[259427, 261531]",Mrs. Norris,"['Lady Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund']",Explicit,said Mrs Norris,"[[], ['us', 'Maria', 'We', 'Edmund', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Tom', 'his', 'we', 'Tom', 'father', 'mother ', 'father', 'father ', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'your father']]","[[], [[259590, 259592], [259630, 259635], [259741, 259743], [259770, 259776], [259781, 259794], [259844, 259847], [259858, 259861], [260054, 260056], [260337, 260340], [260597, 260603], [260622, 260629], [260669, 260675], [260686, 260693], [261097, 261100], [261173, 261177], [261225, 261228], [261464, 261475]]]","[[], [['Lady Bertram', 'Sir Thomas', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Edmund', 'Tom Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris'], ['Maria Bertram'], ['Mrs. Norris', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Tom Bertram', 'Henry Crawford', 'Mary Crawford', 'Mr. Rushworth', 'Mr. Yates'], ['Edmund'], ['Mr. Rushworth'], ['Tom Bertram'], ['Tom Bertram'], ['Tom Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris'], ['Tom Bertram'], ['Sir Thomas'], ['Lady Bertram'], ['Sir Thomas'], ['Sir Thomas'], ['Edmund'], ['Edmund'], ['Edmund'], ['Sir Thomas']]]",F,,intermediate,,,,14,14,13,259427,261531

respect your pheasants, sir, I assure you, as much as you could desire.

Q625,"My dear Sir Thomas, if you had seen the state of the roads _that_ day!
I thought we should never have got through them, though we had the four
horses of course; and poor old coachman would attend us, out of his
great love and kindness, though he was hardly able to sit the box on
account of the rheumatism which I had been doctoring him for ever since
Michaelmas. I cured him at last; but he was very bad all the winter   and
this was such a day, I could not help going to him up in his room
before we set off to advise him not to venture: he was putting on his
wig; so I said,    Coachman, you had much better not go; your Lady and I
shall be very safe; you know how steady Stephen is, and Charles has
been upon the leaders so often now, that I am sure there is no fear.'
But, however, I soon found it would not do; he was bent upon going, and
as I hate to be worrying and officious, I said no more; but my heart
quite ached for him at every jolt, and when we got into the rough lanes
about Stoke, where, what with frost and snow upon beds of stones, it
was worse than anything you can imagine, I was quite in an agony about
him. And then the poor horses too! To see them straining away! You know
how I always feel for the horses. And when we got to the bottom of
Sandcroft Hill, what do you think I did? You will laugh at me; but I
got out and walked up. I did indeed. It might not be saving them much,
but it was something, and I could not bear to sit at my ease and be
dragged up at the expense of those noble animals. I caught a dreadful
cold, but _that_ I did not regard. My object was accomplished in the

Bertram instructions about the living he is to step into so soon. I

have a very pretty income to make ducks and drakes with, and earned
without much trouble. I apprehend he will not have less than seven
hundred a year. Seven hundred a year is a fine thing for a younger
brother; and as of course he will still live at home, it will be all

done. And _there_ must be your approach, through what is at present the

house; which will be giving it the best aspect in the world, sloping to
the south-east. The ground seems precisely formed for it. I rode fifty
yards up the lane, between the church and the house, in order to look
about me; and saw how it might all be. Nothing can be easier. The
meadows beyond what _will_ _be_ the garden, as well as what now _is_,
sweeping round from the lane I stood in to the north-east, that is, to
the principal road through the village, must be all laid together, of

not a scrambling collection of low single rooms, with as many roofs as

not bid a dozen. She will have nothing to say to it. Go on, go on.) By
some such improvements as I have suggested (I do not really require you
to proceed upon my plan, though, by the bye, I doubt anybody's striking
out a better) you may give it a higher character. You may raise it into
a _place_. From being the mere gentleman's residence, it becomes, by
judicious improvement, the residence of a man of education, taste,
modern manners, good connexions. All this may be stamped on it; and
that house receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as the

himself to doing less. It is perfectly natural that you should not have
thought much on the subject, Mr. Crawford. But a parish has wants and
claims which can be known only by a clergyman constantly resident, and
which no proxy can be capable of satisfying to the same extent. Edmund
might, in the common phrase, do the duty of Thornton, that is, he might
read prayers and preach, without giving up Mansfield Park: he might
ride over every Sunday, to a house nominally inhabited, and go through
divine service; he might be the clergyman of Thornton Lacey every
seventh day, for three or four hours, if that would content him. But it
will not. He knows that human nature needs more lessons than a weekly
sermon can convey; and that if he does not live among his parishioners,

he does very little either for their good or his own.","[453726, 454792]",Sir Thomas,"['Edmund', 'Henry Crawford', 'Fanny Price']",Explicit,continued Sir Thomas,"[['We'], ['His', 'our family', 'any son of mine', 'himself', 'you', 'Mr. Crawford', 'Edmund', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'him', 'He', 'he', 'his', 'himself', 'he', 'his']]","[[[453678, 453680]], [[453726, 453729], [453798, 453808], [453860, 453875], [453892, 453899], [453944, 453947], [453993, 454005], [454169, 454175], [454239, 454241], [454307, 454309], [454403, 454405], [454513, 454516], [454535, 454537], [454626, 454628], [454649, 454652], [454677, 454684], [454739, 454741], [454784, 454787]]]","[[['Maria Bertram', 'Fanny Price', 'Tom Bertram', 'Lady Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Sir Thomas']], [['Edmund'], ['Edmund', 'Fanny Price', 'Lady Bertram', 'Julia Bertram', 'Maria Bertram', 'Mrs. Norris', 'Tom Bertram'], ['Tom Bertram', 'Edmund'], ['Tom Bertram', 'Edmund'], ['Henry Crawford'], ['Henry Crawford'], ['Edmund'], ['Edmund'], ['Edmund'], ['Edmund'], ['Edmund'], ['Edmund'], ['Edmund'], ['Edmund'], ['Edmund'], ['Edmund'], ['Edmund']]]",M,,intermediate,,,,24,24,18,453726,454792

natural delicacy as to make the few slight differences, resulting

been, and I believe _has_ _been_, carried too far in your case. I am

distinction; but I think too well of you, Fanny, to suppose you will
ever harbour resentment on that account. You have an understanding

partially by the event. You will take in the whole of the past, you
will consider times, persons, and probabilities, and you will feel that
_they_ were not least your friends who were educating and preparing you
for that mediocrity of condition which _seemed_ to be your lot. Though
their caution may prove eventually unnecessary, it was kindly meant;

be doubled by the little privations and restrictions that may have been

no use, I perceive, to talk to you. We had better put an end to this

waiting. I will, therefore, only add, as thinking it my duty to mark my
opinion of your conduct, that you have disappointed every expectation I
had formed, and proved yourself of a character the very reverse of what
I had supposed. For I _had_, Fanny, as I think my behaviour must have
shewn, formed a very favourable opinion of you from the period of my
return to England. I had thought you peculiarly free from wilfulness of
temper, self-conceit, and every tendency to that independence of spirit
which prevails so much in modern days, even in young women, and which
in young women is offensive and disgusting beyond all common offence.
But you have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse; that you
can and will decide for yourself, without any consideration or
deference for those who have surely some right to guide you, without
even asking their advice. You have shewn yourself very, very different
from anything that I had imagined. The advantage or disadvantage of
your family, of your parents, your brothers and sisters, never seems to
have had a moment's share in your thoughts on this occasion. How _they_
might be benefited, how _they_ must rejoice in such an establishment
for you, is nothing to _you_. You think only of yourself, and because
you do not feel for Mr. Crawford exactly what a young heated fancy
imagines to be necessary for happiness, you resolve to refuse him at
once, without wishing even for a little time to consider of it, a
little more time for cool consideration, and for really examining your
own inclinations; and are, in a wild fit of folly, throwing away from
you such an opportunity of being settled in life, eligibly, honourably,
nobly settled, as will, probably, never occur to you again. Here is a
young man of sense, of character, of temper, of manners, and of
fortune, exceedingly attached to you, and seeking your hand in the most
handsome and disinterested way; and let me tell you, Fanny, that you
may live eighteen years longer in the world without being addressed by
a man of half Mr. Crawford's estate, or a tenth part of his merits.

to speak well than to compose well; that is, the rules and trick of
composition are oftener an object of study. A thoroughly good sermon,
thoroughly well delivered, is a capital gratification. I can never hear
such a one without the greatest admiration and respect, and more than
half a mind to take orders and preach myself. There is something in the
eloquence of the pulpit, when it is really eloquence, which is entitled
to the highest praise and honour. The preacher who can touch and affect
such an heterogeneous mass of hearers, on subjects limited, and long
worn threadbare in all common hands; who can say anything new or
striking, anything that rouses the attention without offending the
taste, or wearing out the feelings of his hearers, is a man whom one

everything in so just a light. I knew she was very fond of you; but yet
I was afraid of her not estimating your worth to her brother quite as
it deserved, and of her regretting that he had not rather fixed on some
woman of distinction or fortune. I was afraid of the bias of those
worldly maxims, which she has been too much used to hear. But it was
very different. She spoke of you, Fanny, just as she ought. She desires
the connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself. We had a long talk
about it. I should not have mentioned the subject, though very anxious
to know her sentiments; but I had not been in the room five minutes
before she began introducing it with all that openness of heart, and
sweet peculiarity of manner, that spirit and ingenuousness which are so
much a part of herself.

man's not being approved, not being loved by some one of her sex at
least, let him be ever so generally agreeable. Let him have all the

certain that a man must be acceptable to every woman he may happen to
like himself. But, even supposing it is so, allowing Mr. Crawford to
have all the claims which his sisters think he has, how was I to be
prepared to meet him with any feeling answerable to his own? He took me
wholly by surprise. I had not an idea that his behaviour to me before
had any meaning; and surely I was not to be teaching myself to like him
only because he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me. In my
situation, it would have been the extreme of vanity to be forming
expectations on Mr. Crawford. I am sure his sisters, rating him as they
do, must have thought it so, supposing he had meant nothing. How, then,
was I to be   to be in love with him the moment he said he was with me?
How was I to have an attachment at his service, as soon as it was asked
for? His sisters should consider me as well as him. The higher his
deserts, the more improper for me ever to have thought of him. And,

Q1069,"Why, Fanny, you are absolutely in a reverie. Thinking, I hope, of one
who is always thinking of you. Oh! that I could transport you for a
short time into our circle in town, that you might understand how your
power over Henry is thought of there! Oh! the envyings and
heartburnings of dozens and dozens; the wonder, the incredulity that
will be felt at hearing what you have done! For as to secrecy, Henry is
quite the hero of an old romance, and glories in his chains. You should
come to London to know how to estimate your conquest. If you were to
see how he is courted, and how I am courted for his sake! Now, I am
well aware that I shall not be half so welcome to Mrs. Fraser in
consequence of his situation with you. When she comes to know the truth
she will, very likely, wish me in Northamptonshire again; for there is
a daughter of Mr. Fraser, by a first wife, whom she is wild to get
married, and wants Henry to take. Oh! she has been trying for him to
such a degree. Innocent and quiet as you sit here, you cannot have an
idea of the _sensation_ that you will be occasioning, of the curiosity
there will be to see you, of the endless questions I shall have to
answer! Poor Margaret Fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and
your teeth, and how you do your hair, and who makes your shoes. I wish
Margaret were married, for my poor friend's sake, for I look upon the
Frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people. And yet it
was a most desirable match for Janet at the time. We were all
delighted. She could not do otherwise than accept him, for he was rich,
and she had nothing; but he turns out ill-tempered and _exigeant_, and
wants a young woman, a beautiful young woman of five-and-twenty, to be
as steady as himself. And my friend does not manage him well; she does
not seem to know how to make the best of it. There is a spirit of
irritation which, to say nothing worse, is certainly very ill-bred. In
their house I shall call to mind the conjugal manners of Mansfield
Parsonage with respect. Even Dr. Grant does shew a thorough confidence
in my sister, and a certain consideration for her judgment, which makes
one feel there _is_ attachment; but of that I shall see nothing with
the Frasers. I shall be at Mansfield for ever, Fanny. My own sister as
a wife, Sir Thomas Bertram as a husband, are my standards of
perfection. Poor Janet has been sadly taken in, and yet there was
nothing improper on her side: she did not run into the match
inconsiderately; there was no want of foresight. She took three days to
consider of his proposals, and during those three days asked the advice
of everybody connected with her whose opinion was worth having, and
especially applied to my late dear aunt, whose knowledge of the world
made her judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the
young people of her acquaintance, and she was decidedly in favour of
Mr. Fraser. This seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial
comfort. I have not so much to say for my friend Flora, who jilted a
very nice young man in the Blues for the sake of that horrid Lord
Stornaway, who has about as much sense, Fanny, as Mr. Rushworth, but
much worse-looking, and with a blackguard character. I _had_ my doubts
at the time about her being right, for he has not even the air of a
gentleman, and now I am sure she was wrong. By the bye, Flora Ross was
dying for Henry the first winter she came out. But were I to attempt to
tell you of all the women whom I have known to be in love with him, I
should never have done. It is you, only you, insensible Fanny, who can
think of him with anything like indifference. But are you so insensible

you had your orders to-morrow: but you cannot sail with this wind, if
you are to cruise to the westward; and Captain Walsh thinks you will
certainly have a cruise to the westward, with the Elephant. By G   , I
wish you may! But old Scholey was saying, just now, that he thought you
would be sent first to the Texel. Well, well, we are ready, whatever
happens. But by G   , you lost a fine sight by not being here in the
morning to see the Thrush go out of harbour! I would not have been out
of the way for a thousand pounds. Old Scholey ran in at breakfast-time,
to say she had slipped her moorings and was coming out, I jumped up,
and made but two steps to the platform. If ever there was a perfect
beauty afloat, she is one; and there she lays at Spithead, and anybody
in England would take her for an eight-and-twenty. I was upon the

that I will be master of my own property. I was not explicit enough

nature. I do not consider her as meaning to wound my feelings. The evil
lies yet deeper: in her total ignorance, unsuspiciousness of there

her to treat the subject as she did. She was speaking only as she had
been used to hear others speak, as she imagined everybody else would
speak. Hers are not faults of temper. She would not voluntarily give
unnecessary pain to any one, and though I may deceive myself, I cannot
but think that for me, for my feelings, she would   . Hers are faults of
principle, Fanny; of blunted delicacy and a corrupted, vitiated mind.

Q1156,"I shall soon have done. I have
told you the substance of all that she said. As soon as I could speak,
I replied that I had not supposed it possible, coming in such a state
of mind into that house as I had done, that anything could occur to
make me suffer more, but that she had been inflicting deeper wounds in
almost every sentence. That though I had, in the course of our
acquaintance, been often sensible of some difference in our opinions,
on points, too, of some moment, it had not entered my imagination to
conceive the difference could be such as she had now proved it. That
the manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed by her
brother and my sister (with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended
not to say), but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself,
giving it every reproach but the right; considering its ill
consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance
of decency and impudence in wrong; and last of all, and above all,
recommending to us a compliance, a compromise, an acquiescence in the
continuance of the sin, on the chance of a marriage which, thinking as
I now thought of her brother, should rather be prevented than sought;
all this together most grievously convinced me that I had never
understood her before, and that, as far as related to mind, it had been
the creature of my own imagination, not Miss Crawford, that I had been
too apt to dwell on for many months past. That, perhaps, it was best
for me; I had less to regret in sacrificing a friendship, feelings,
hopes which must, at any rate, have been torn from me now. And yet,
that I must and would confess that, could I have restored her to what
she had appeared to me before, I would infinitely prefer any increase
of the pain of parting, for the sake of carrying with me the right of
tenderness and esteem. This is what I said, the purport of it; but, as
you may imagine, not spoken so collectedly or methodically as I have
repeated it to you. She was astonished, exceedingly astonished   more
than astonished. I saw her change countenance. She turned extremely
red. I imagined I saw a mixture of many feelings: a great, though short
struggle; half a wish of yielding to truths, half a sense of shame, but
habit, habit carried it. She would have laughed if she could. It was a
sort of laugh, as she answered,","[852306, 854650]",Edmund,['Fanny Price'],Anaphoric,said he,"[['you', 'she', 'she', 'our', 'our ', 'she', 'she', 'her\nbrother', 'my sister', 'she', 'us', 'her brother', 'her', 'Miss Crawford', 'her', 'she', 'you', 'you', 'She', 'her', 'She', 'She', 'she', 'she']]","[[[852342, 852345], [852372, 852375], [852576, 852579], [852676, 852679], [852736, 852740], [852860, 852863], [852908, 852911], [852952, 852963], [852968, 852977], [853064, 853067], [853309, 853311], [853451, 853462], [853579, 853582], [853680, 853693], [853974, 853977], [853986, 853989], [854197, 854200], [854281, 854284], [854286, 854289], [854359, 854362], [854383, 854386], [854573, 854576], [854599, 854602], [854637, 854640]]]","[[['Fanny Price'], ['Mary Crawford'], ['Mary Crawford'], ['Mary Crawford', 'Edmund'], ['Mary Crawford', 'Edmund'], ['Mary Crawford'], ['Mary Crawford'], ['Henry Crawford'], ['Maria Bertram'], ['Mary Crawford'], ['Edmund'], ['Henry Crawford'], ['Mary Crawford'], ['Mary Crawford'], ['Mary Crawford'], ['Mary Crawford'], ['Fanny Price'], ['Fanny Price'], ['Mary Crawford'], ['Mary Crawford'], ['Mary Crawford'], ['Mary Crawford'], ['Mary Crawford'], ['Mary Crawford']]]",M,,major,,,,46,46,2,852306,854650
