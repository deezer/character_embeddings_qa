as you have been accustomed to consider every other question, simply as
one of tangible Fact.  The ignorant and the giddy may embarrass such
subjects with irrelevant fancies, and other absurdities that have no
existence, properly viewed   really no existence   but it is no compliment to
you to say, that you know better.  Now, what are the Facts of this case?
You are, we will say in round numbers, twenty years of age; Mr. Bounderby
is, we will say in round numbers, fifty.  There is some disparity in your
respective years, but in your means and positions there is none; on the
contrary, there is a great suitability.  Then the question arises, Is
this one disparity sufficient to operate as a bar to such a marriage?  In
considering this question, it is not unimportant to take into account the
statistics of marriage, so far as they have yet been obtained, in England
and Wales.  I find, on reference to the figures, that a large proportion
of these marriages are contracted between parties of very unequal ages,
and that the elder of these contracting parties is, in rather more than
three-fourths of these instances, the bridegroom.  It is remarkable as
showing the wide prevalence of this law, that among the natives of the
British possessions in India, also in a considerable part of China, and
among the Calmucks of Tartary, the best means of computation yet
furnished us by travellers, yield similar results.  The disparity I have
mentioned, therefore, almost ceases to be disparity, and (virtually) all
but disappears.","[186491, 188086]",Thomas Gradgrind,['Louisa Bounderby'],Explicit,said Mr Gradgrind,"[['my dear Louisa', 'Louisa'], ['you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'You', 'we', 'Mr. Bounderby', 'we', 'your', 'your']]","[[[186418, 186432], [186426, 186432]], [[186506, 186509], [186517, 186520], [186559, 186562], [186844, 186847], [186861, 186864], [186917, 186920], [186926, 186928], [186977, 186990], [186995, 186997], [187060, 187064], [187090, 187094]]]","[[['Louisa Bounderby'], ['Louisa Bounderby']], [['Louisa Bounderby'], ['Louisa Bounderby'], ['Louisa Bounderby'], ['Louisa Bounderby'], ['Louisa Bounderby'], ['Louisa Bounderby'], ['Louisa Bounderby', 'Thomas Gradgrind'], ['Josiah Bounderby'], ['Louisa Bounderby', 'Thomas Gradgrind'], ['Louisa Bounderby'], ['Louisa Bounderby']]]",M,,major,,,,14,14,17,186491,188086

exception which makes our people quite reviving.  You saw and heard the

esteemed friend Mr. Bounderby   who, as we know, is not possessed of that
delicacy which would soften so tight a hand.  The member of the fluffy
classes was injured, exasperated, left the house grumbling, met somebody
who proposed to him to go in for some share in this Bank business, went
in, put something in his pocket which had nothing in it before, and
relieved his mind extremely.  Really he would have been an uncommon,
instead of a common, fellow, if he had not availed himself of such an
