HISTORICAL NOTES TO CHORUS \u2014 ACT SECOND .These corrupted men ,\u2014\u2014 One , Richard earl of Cambridge ; and the second , Henry lord Scroop of Masham ; and the third , Sir Thomas Grey knight of Northumberland ,\u2014 Have for the guilt of FranceConfirm \u2019 d conspiracy with fearful France . About the end of July , Henry \u2019 s ambitious designs received a momentary check from the discovery of a treasonable conspiracy against his person and government , by Richard , Earl of Cambridge , brother of the Duke of York ; Henry , Lord Scroop of Masham , the Lord Treasurer ; and Sir Thomas Grey , of Heton , knight . The king \u2019 s command for the investigation of the affair , was dated on the 21st of that month , and a writ was issued to the Sheriff of Southampton , to assemble a jury for their trial ; and which on Friday , the 2nd of August , found that on the 20th of July , Richard , Earl of Cambridge , and Thomas Grey , of Heton , in the County of Northumberland , knight , had falsely and traitorously conspired to collect a body of armed men , to conduct Edmund , Earl of March ,to the frontiers of Wales , and to proclaim him the rightful heir to the crown , in case Richard II . was actually dead ; but they had solicited Thomas Frumpyngton , who personated King Richard , Henry Percy , and many others from Scotland to invade the realm , that they had intended to destroy the King , the Duke of Clarence , the Duke of Bedford , the Duke of Gloucester , with other lords and great men ; and that Henry , Lord Scroop , of Masham , consented to the said treasonable purposes , and concealed the knowledge of them from the king . On the same day the accused were reported by Sir John Popham , Constable of the Castle of Southampton , to whose custody they had been committed , to have confessed the justice of the charges brought against them , and that they threw themselves on the king \u2019 s mercy ; but Scroop endeavoured to extenuate his conduct , by asserting that his intentions were innocent , and that he appeared only to acquiesce in their designs to be enabled to defeat them . The Earl and Lord Scroop having claimed the privilege of being tried by the peers , were remanded to prison , but sentence of death in the usual manner was pronounced against Grey , and he was immediately executed ; though , in consequence of Henry having dispensed with his being drawn and hung , he was allowed to walk from the Watergate to the Northgate of the town of Southampton , where he was beheaded . A commission was soon afterwards issued , addressed to the Duke of Clarence , for the trial of the Earl of Cambridge and Lord Scroop : this court unanimously declared the prisoners guilty , and sentence of death having been denounced against them , they paid the forfeit of their lives on Monday , the 5th of August . In consideration of the earl being of the blood royal , he was merely beheaded ; but to mark the perfidy and ingratitude of Scroop , who had enjoyed the king \u2019 s utmost confidence and friendship , and had even shared his bed , he commanded that he should be drawn to the place of execution , and that his head should be affixed on one of the gates of the city of York . \u2014 Nicolas \u2019 s History of the Battle of Agincourt .HISTORICAL NOTES TO ACT SECOND .\u2014\u2014 the man that was his bedfellow ,] So , Holinshed : \u201c The said Lord Scroop was in such favour with the king , that he admitted him sometimes to be his bedfellow .\u201d The familiar appellation , of bedfellow , which appears strange to us , was common among the ancient nobility . There is a letter from the sixth Earl of Northumberland, addressed \u201c To his beloved cousin , Thomas Arundel ,\u201d & c ., which begins \u201c Bedfellow , after my most hast\u00e9 recommendation .\u201d \u2014 Steevens . This unseemly custom continued common till the middle of the last century , if not later . Cromwell obtained much of his intelligence , during the civil wars , from the mean men with whom he slept . \u2014 Malone . After the battle of Dreux , 1562 , the Prince of Cond\u00e9 slept in the same bed with the Duke of Guise ; an anecdote frequently cited , to show the magnanimity of the latter , who slept soundly , though so near his greatest enemy , then his prisoner . \u2014 Nares .For me ,\u2014 the gold of France did not seduce ;] Holinshed observes , \u201c that Richard , Earl of Cambridge , did not conspire with the Lord Scroop and Thomas Grey , for the murdering of King Henry to please the French king , but only to the intent to exalt to the crown his brother-in-law Edmund , Earl of March , as heir to Lionel , Duke of Clarence ; after the death of which Earl of March , for divers secret impediments not able to have issue , the Earl of Cambridge was sure that the crown should come to him by his wife , and to his children of her begotten ; and therefore, he rather confessed himself for need of money to be corrupted by the French king , than he would declare his inward mind , & c ., which if it were espied , he saw plainly that the Earl of March should have tasted of the same cup that he had drunk , and what should have come to his own children he merely doubted , & c .\u201d A million of gold is stated to have been given by France to the conspirators . Historians have , however , generally expressed their utter inability to explain upon what grounds the conspirators built their expectation of success ; and unless they had been promised powerful assistance from France , the design seems to have been one of the most absurd and hopeless upon record . The confession of the Earl of Cambridge , and his supplication for mercy in his own hand writing , is in the British Museum .Touching our person , seek we no revenge ;] This speech is taken from Holinshed :\u2014 \u201c Revenge herein touching my person , though I seek not ; yet for the safeguard of my dear friends , and for due preservation of all sorts , I am by office to cause example to be showed : Get ye hence , therefore , you poor miserable wretches , to the receiving of your just reward , wherein God \u2019 s majesty give you grace of his mercy , and repentance of your heinous offences .\u201dCheerly to sea ; the signs of war advance :] \u201c The king went from his castle of Porchester in a small vessel to the sea , and embarking on board his ship , called The Trinity , between the ports of Southampton and Portsmouth , he immediately ordered that the sail should be set , to signify his readiness to depart .\u201d \u201c There were about fifteen hundred vessels , including about a hundred which were left behind . After having passed the Isle of Wight , swans were seen swimming in the midst of the fleet , which , in the opinion of all , were said to be happy auspices of the undertaking . On the next day , the king entered the mouth of the Seine , and cast anchor before a place called Kidecaus , about three miles from Harfleur , where he proposed landing .\u201d \u2014 Nicolas \u2019 s History of Agincourt . The departure of Henry \u2019 s army on this occasion , and the separation between those who composed it and their relatives and friends , is thus described by Drayton , who was born in 1563 , and died in 1631 :\u2014 There might a man have seen in every street , The father bidding farewell to his son ; Small children kneeling at their father \u2019 s feet : The wife with her dear husband ne \u2019 er had done : Brother , his brother , with adieu to greet : One friend to take leave of another , run ; The maiden with her best belov \u2019 d to part , Gave him her hand who took away her heart . The nobler youth the common rank above , On their curveting coursers mounted fair : One wore his mistress \u2019 garter , one her glove ; And he a lock of his dear lady \u2019 s hair : And he her colours , whom he did most love ; There was not one but did some favour wear : And each one took it , on his happy speed , To make it famous by some knightly deed .Enter the FRENCH KING , the DAUPHIN , the DUKE OF BURGUNDY , the CONSTABLE , and others . ] Charles VI ., surnamed the Well Beloved , was King of France during the most disastrous period of its history . He ascended the throne in 1380 , when only thirteen years of age . In 1385 he married Isabella of Bavaria , who was equally remarkable for her beauty and her depravity . The unfortunate king was subject to fits of insanity , which lasted for several months at a time . On the 21st October , 1422 , seven years after the battle of Agincourt , Charles VI . ended his unhappy life at the age of 55 , having reigned 42 years . Lewis the Dauphin was the eldest son of Charles VI . He was born 22nd January , 1396 , and died before his father , December 18th , 1415 , in his twentieth year . History says , \u201c Shortly after the battle of Agincourt , either for melancholy that he had for the loss , or by some sudden disease , Lewis , Dovphin of Viennois , heir apparent to the French king , departed this life without issue .\u201d John , Duke of Burgundy , surnamed the Fearless , succeeded to the dukedom in 1403 . He caused the Duke of Orleans to be assassinated in the streets of Paris , and was himself murdered August 28 , 1419 , on the bridge of Montereau , at an interview with the Dauphin , afterwards Charles VII . John was succeeded by his only son , who bore the title of Philip the Good , Duke of Burgundy .

To-night in Harfleurwill we be your guest ; To-morrow for the march are we addrest .\u201c Our King , who sought peace , not war , in order that he might further arm the cause in which he was engaged with the shield of justice offered peace to the besieged , if they would open the gates to him , and restore , as was their duty , freely , without compulsion , that town , the noble hereditary portion of his Crown of England , and of his Dukedom of Normandy . \u201c But as they , despising and setting at nought this offer , strove to keep possession of , and to defend the town against him , our King summoned to fight , as it were , against his will , called upon God to witness his just cause * * * hegave himself no rest by day or night , until having fitted and fixed his engines and guns under the walls , he had planted them within shot of the enemy , against the front of the town , and against the walls , gates , and towers , of the same * * * so that taking aim at the place to be battered , the guns from beneath blew forth stones by the force of ignited powers , * * * and in the mean time our King , with his guns and engines , so battered the said bulwark , and the walls and towers on every side , that within a few days , by the impetuosity and fury of the stones , the same bulwark was in a great part broken down ; and the walls and towers from which the enemy had sent forth their weapons , the bastions falling in ruins , were rendered defenceless ; and very fine edifices , even in the middle of the city , either lay altogether in ruins , or threatened an inevitable fall ; or at least were so shaken as to be exceedingly damaged . * * * And although our guns had disarmed the bulwark , walls , and towers during the day , the besieged by night , with logs , faggots , and tubs on vessels full of earth , mud , and sand or stones , piled up within the shattered walls , and with other barricadoes , refortified the streets . * * * The King had caused towers and wooden bulwarks to the height of the walls , and ladders and other instruments , besides those which he had brought with him for the assault .\u201d \u2014 We are then told that the enemy contrived to set these engines on fire \u2019 by means of powders , and combustibles prepared on the walls .\u2019 The History then states that \u201c a fire broke out where the strength of the French was greater , and the French themselves were overcome with resisting , and in endeavouring to extinguish the fire , until at length by force of arms , darts , and flames , their strength was destroyed . Leaving the place therefore to our party , they fled and retreated beneath the walls for protection ; most carefully blocking up the entrance with timber , stones , earth , and mud , lest our people should rush in upon them through the same passage .\u201d \u201c On the following day a conference was held with the Lord de Gaucort , who acted as Captain , and with the more powerful leaders , whether it was the determination of the inhabitants to surrender the town without suffering further rigour of death or war . * * * On that night they entered into a treaty with the King , that if the French King , or the Dauphin , his first-born , being informed , should not raise the seige , and deliver them by force of arms within the first hour after morn on the Sunday following , they would surrender to him the town , and themselves , and their property .\u201d \u201c And neither at the aforesaid hour on the following Sunday , nor within the time , the French King , the Dauphin , nor any one else , coming forward to raise the siege . * * * The aforesaid Lord de Gaucort came from the town into the king \u2019 s presence , accompanied by those persons who before had sworn to keep the articles , and surrendering to him the keys of the Corporation , submitted themselves , together with the citizens , to his grace . * * * Then the banners of St. George and the King were fixed upon the gates of the town , and the King advanced his illustrious uncle , the Lord Thomas Beaufort , Earl of Dorsetto be keeper and captain of the town , having delivered to him the keys .\u201d Thus , after a vigorous siege of about thirty-six days , one of the most important towns of Normandy fell into the hands of the invaders . The Chronicler in the text informs us , that the dysentery had carried off infinitely more of the English army than were slain in the siege ; that about five thousand men were then so dreadfully debilitated by that disease , that they were unable to proceed , and were therefore sent to England ; that three hundred men-at-arms and nine hundred archers were left to garrison Harfleur ; that great numbers had cowardly deserted the King , and returned home by stealth ; and that after all these deductions , not more than nine hundred lances and five thousand archers remained fit for service . Hume , in his History of England , relates that \u201c King Henry landed near Harfleur , at the head of an army of 6 , 000 men-at-arms , and 24 , 000 foot , mostly archers . He immediately began the siege of that place , which was valiantly defended by d \u2019 Esto\u00fcleville , and under him by de Guitri , de Gaucourt , and others of the French nobility ; but as the garrison was weak , and the fortifications in bad repair , the governor was at last obliged to capitulate , and he promised to surrender the place if he received no succour before the 18th of September . The day came , and there was no appearance of a French army to relieve him . Henry , taking possession of the town , placed a garrison in it , and expelled all the French inhabitants , with an intention of peopling it anew with English . The fatigues of this siege , and the unusual heat of the season , had so wasted the English army , that Henry could enter on no farther enterprise , and was obliged to think of returning to England . He had dismissed his transports , which could not anchor in an open road upon the enemy \u2019 s coasts , and he lay under a necessity of marching by land to Calais before he could reach a place of safety . A numerous French army of 14 , 000 men at-arms , and 40 , 000 foot , was by this time assembled in Normandy , under the constable d \u2019 Albret , a force which , if prudently conducted , was sufficient either to trample down the English in the open field , or to harass and reduce to nothing their small army before they could finish so long and difficult a march . Henry , therefore , cautiously offered to sacrifice his conquest of Harfleur for a safe passage to Calais ; but his proposal being rejected , he determined to make his way by valour and conduct through all the opposition of the enemy .\u201d]", "Hen .

HISTORICAL NOTES TO ACT THIRD .Come you from the bridge ? ] After Henry had passed the Somme , Titus Livius asserts , that the King having been informed of a river which must be crossed , over which was a bridge , and that his progress depended in a great degree upon securing possession of it , despatched some part of his forces to defend it from any attack , or from being destroyed . They found many of the enemy ready to receive them , to whom they gave battle , and after a severe conflict , they captured the bridge , and kept it .Fortune is Bardolph \u2019 s foe , and frowns on him ; For he hath stol \u2019 n a pix , and hanged must \u2019 a be . It will be seen by the following extract from the anonymous Chronicler how minutely Shakespeare has adhered to history \u2014 \u201c There was brought to the King in that plain a certain English robber , who , contrary to the laws of God and the Royal Proclamation , had stolen from a church a pix of copper gilt , found in his sleeve , which he happened to mistake for gold , in which the Lord \u2019 s body was kept ; and in the next village where he passed the night , by decree of the King , he was put to death on the gallows .\u201d Titus Livius relates that Henry commanded his army to halt until the sacrilege was expiated . He first caused the pix to be restored to the Church , and the offender was then led , bound as a thief , through the army , and afterwards hung upon a tree , that every man might behold him .Go , bid thy master well advise himself : If we may pass , we will ; if we be hinder \u2019 d , We shall your tawny ground with your red blood Discolour :] My desire is , that none of you be so unadvised , as to be the occasion that I in my defence shall colour and make red your tawny ground with the effusion of Christian blood .

We just begin to have glimpses of the effects of the mind upon the body . To me , Akron , the faculty has set too great store upon herbs and bitter drafts , and cutting with the knife . I would fain have the soul acknowledged more , our therapy built on the dual mechanism of mind and substance . For if an idea can lead to the apparent death of the whole body , so might other ideas bring about the apparent death of a part of the body , like , for example , a paralysis of the members , or of the senses of sight , feeling , hearing ; and in truth I have seen such things . Or a thought might give rise to a pain , or to a feeling of general illness , or to a feeling of local disorder in some internal organ ; and I feel sure I have likewise met with such instances . And if an idea may produce such ailments , then a contrary idea implanted by the physician may heal them . I believe this to be the secret of many of the marvels we see at the temples and shrines of \u00c6sculapius and of the cures made by the touch of seers and kings . But this teaching goes much deeper and further . If we could in the schools implant in our youth ideas which were strong enough , we should be able to make of them all , each in proportion to his belief in himself and his ambition , great men , great generals , thinkers , poets , a new race of heroes in all lines of human endeavor , who should be able by their united strength of idea and ideal finally to people the world with gods . I have among my slaves , who work as vintners and olive-gatherers , a physician of Thrace , as also a philosopher of the island of Rhodes , a member of the Pythagorean League . These I bought not long ago from the Etruscan pirates . Every evening I have them come to me on the roof after the evening meal , and there under the quiet of the stars we discuss life and death , the soul and immortality , and all the burning problems of order , harmony , and number in the universe . What surprises me is that this Thracian should be so in advance of the physicians of Hellas , for he holds as I do that the mind should be first considered in the treatment of most disorders of the body , because of its tremendous power to force the healing processes , and because sometimes it actually induces disease and death . And we have talked together of the incalculable value of faith and enthusiasm so applied in the education of the child , this new kind of gardening in the budding soul of mankind , and of what new and august races might thereby come to repeople this rather unsatisfactory globe . I am minded to free these slaves , indeed all my slaves , and I have the intention of devoting the most of a considerable fortune , both inherited and amassed by me , to the spread of these doctrines and to the public weal , particularly in the matter of planting in the souls of our youth , not the mere ability to read and write Greek and do sums in arithmetic , but the seeds of noble ideas that shall make this Trinacria of ours a still more wonderful human garden than it has been as a granary for the world 's practical needs . From this sea-centre we send our freighted galleys to Gades in the West , Carthage in the South , Tyre in the East , and to the red-bearded foresters of the Far North .

They cheat , but still from cheating sires they come ; They drink , but they were christened first in mum . Their patrimonial sloth the Spaniards keep , And Philip first taught Philip how to sleep . The French and we still change ; but here 's the curse , They change for better , and we change for worse ; They take up our old trade of conquering , And we are taking theirs , to dance and sing : Our fathers did , for change , to France repair , And they , for change , will try our English air ; As children , when they throw one toy away , Strait a more foolish gewgaw comes in play : So we , grown penitent , on serious thinking , Leave whoring , and devoutly fall to drinking . Scowering the watch grows out-of-fashion wit : Now we set up for tilting in the pit , Where \u2018 tis agreed by bullies chicken-hearted , To fright the ladies first , and then be parted . A fair attempt has twice or thrice been made , To hire night murderers , and make death a tradeWhen murder 's out , what vice can we advance ? Unless the new-found poisoning trick of France : And , when their art of rats-bane we have got , By way of thanks , we 'll send them o'er our plot . Footnotes 1 .
