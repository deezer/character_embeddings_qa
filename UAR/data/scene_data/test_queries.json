HISTORICAL NOTES TO ACT FIRST .KING HENRY on his throne ,] King Henry V. was born at Monmouth , August 9th , 1388 , from which place he took his surname . He was the eldest son of Henry Bolingbroke , Earl of Derby , afterwards Duke of Hereford , who was banished by King Richard the Second , and , after that monarch \u2019 s deposition , was made king of England , A. D. 1399 . At eleven years of age Henry V. was a student at Queen \u2019 s College , Oxford , under the tuition of his half-uncle , Henry Beaufort , Chancellor of that university . Richard II . took the young Henry with him in his expedition to Ireland , and caused him to be imprisoned in the castle of Trym , but , when his father , the Duke of Hereford , deposed the king and obtained the crown , he was created Prince of Wales and Duke of Cornwall . In 1403 the Prince was engaged at the battle of Shrewsbury , where the famous Hotspur was slain , and there wounded in the face by an arrow . History states that Prince Henry became the companion of rioters and disorderly persons , and indulged in a course of life quite unworthy of his high station . There is a tradition that , under the influence of wine , he assisted his associates in robbing passengers on the highway . His being confined in prison for striking the Chief Justice , Sir William Gascoigne , is well known . These excesses gave great uneasiness and annoyance to the king , his father , who dismissed the Prince from the office of President of his Privy Council , and appointed in his stead his second son , Thomas , Duke of Clarence . Henry was crowned King of England on the 9th April , 1413 . We read in Stowe \u2014 \u201c After his coronation King Henry called unto him all those young lords and gentlemen who were the followers of his young acts , to every one of whom he gave rich gifts , and then commanded that as many as would change their manners , as he intended to do , should abide with him at court ; and to all that would persevere in their former like conversation , he gave express commandment , upon pain of their heads , never after that day to come in his presence .\u201d This heroic king fought and won the celebrated battle of Agincourt , on the 25th October , 1415 ; married the Princess Katherine , daughter of Charles VI . of France and Isabella of Bavaria , his queen , in the year 1420 ; and died at Vincennes , near Paris , in the midst of his military glory , August 31st , 1422 , in the thirty-fourth year of his age , and the tenth of his reign , leaving an infant son , who succeeded to the throne under the title of Henry VI . The famous Whittington was for the third time Lord Mayor of London in this reign , A. D. 1419 . Thomas Chaucer , son of the great poet , was speaker of the House of Commons , which granted the supplies to the king for his invasion of France .Bedford ,] John , Duke of Bedford , was the third son of King Henry IV ., and his brother , Henry V ., left to him the Regency of France . He died in the year 1435 . This duke was accounted one of the best generals of the royal race of Plantaganet . King Lewis XI . being counselled by certain envious persons to deface his tomb , used these , indeed , princely words :\u2014 \u201c What honor shall it be to us , or you , to break this monument , and to pull out of the ground the bones of him , whom , in his life time , neither my father nor your progenitors , with all their puissance , were once able to make fly a foot backward ? Who by his strength , policy , and wit , kept them all out of the principal dominions of France , and out of this noble Dutchy of Normandy ? Wherefore I say first , God save his soul , and let his body now lie in rest , which , when he was alive , would have disquieted the proudest of us all ; and for his tomb , I assure you , it is not so worthy or convenient as his honor and acts have deserved .\u201d \u2014 Vide Sandford \u2019 s History of the Kings of England .Gloster ,] Humphrey , Duke of Gloster , was the fourth son of King Henry IV ., and on the death of his brother , Henry V ., became Regent of England . It is generally supposed he was strangled . His death took place in the year 1446 .Exeter ,] Shakespeare is a little too early in giving Thomas Beaufort the title of Duke of Exeter ; for when Harfleur was taken , and he was appointed governor of the town , he was only Earl of Dorset . He was not made Duke of Exeter till the year after the battle of Agincourt , November 14 , 1416 . Exeter was half brother to King Henry IV ., being one of the sons of John of Gaunt , by Catherine Swynford .Archbishop of Canterbury ,] The Archbishop \u2019 s speech in this scene , explaining King Henry \u2019 s title to the crown of France , is closely copied from Holinshed \u2019 s chronicle , page 545 . \u201c About the middle of the year 1414 , Henry V ., influenced by the persuasions of Chichely , Archbishop of Canterbury , by the dying injunction of his royal father , not to allow the kingdom to remain long at peace , or more probably by those feelings of ambition , which were no less natural to his age and character , than consonant with the manners of the time in which he lived , resolved to assert that claim to the crown of France which his great grandfather , King Edward the Third , had urged with such confidence and success .\u201d \u2014 Nicolas \u2019 s History of the Battle of Agincourt .", "Yes , that \u2019 a did , and said they were devils incarnate ."]}, "act_index": 24, "play_index": 3}, {"data": {"140": ["\u2019 Fore Heaven , his grace is bold , to trust these traitors ."]}, "act_index": 25, "play_index": 3}, {"data": {"141": ["Whom he hath cloy \u2019 d and grac \u2019 d with princely favours ,\u2014", "They shall be apprehended by and by .", "Distant Trumpets sound .

The night was very rainy , and much inconvenience is said to have been experienced in each camp from wet and cold , accompanied , among the English , by hunger and fatigue . It was passed in a manner strictly consistent with their relative situations . The French , confident in their numbers , occupied the hours not appropriated to sleep in calculating upon their success ; and in full security of a complete victory , played at dice with each other for the disposal of their prisoners , an archer being valued at a blank , and the more important persons in proportion ; whilst the English were engaged in preparing their weapons , and in the most solemn acts of religion . * * * The Chronicler in the text states , that from the great stillness which prevailed throughout the English camp , the enemy imagined they were panic-struck , and intended to decamp . Monstrelet relates that the English \u201c were much fatigued and oppressed by cold , hunger , and other annoyances ; that they made their peace with God , by confessing their sins with tears , and numbers of them taking the sacrament ; for , as it was related by some prisoners , they looked for certain death on the morrow .\u201dEnter Erpingham . ] Sir Thomas Erpingham came over with Bolingbroke from Bretagne , and was one of the commissioners to receive King Richard \u2019 s abdication . In Henry the Fifth \u2019 s time Sir Thomas was warden of Dover Castle , and at the battle of Agincourt , was commander of the Archers . This venerable knight is described by Monstrelet to have grown grey with age and honour ; and when orders were given for the English army to march toward the enemy , by Henry crying aloud , \u201c Advance banners ,\u201d Sir Thomas threw his truncheon in the air as a signal to the whole field , exclaiming , \u201c Now strike ;\u201d and loud and repeated shouts testified the readiness with which they obeyed the command .I Richard \u2019 s body have interred new ;] Henry was anxious not only to repair his own misconduct , but also to make amends for those iniquities into which policy or the necessity of affairs had betrayed his father . He expressed the deepest sorrow for the fate of the unhappy Richard , did justice to the memory of that unfortunate prince , even performed his funeral obsequies with pomp and solemnity , and cherished all those who had distinguished themselves by their loyalty and attachment towards him . \u2014 Hume \u2019 s History of England .Enter Orleans . ] Charles Duke of Orleans was wounded and taken prisoner at Agincourt . Henry refused all ransom for him , and he remained in captivity twenty-three years . This prince was a celebrated poet , and some of his most beautiful verses were composed during his confinement in the Tower of London . He married Isabella of Valois , daughter of Charles VI . and Isabeau of Bavaria , eldest sister to the Princess Katharine , Queen of Henry V . Isabella was the widow of our Richard the Second when she married the Duke of Orleans . After the victory of Agincourt , the following anecdote is related by Remy :\u2014 \u201c During their journey to Calais , at a place where they rested , Henry caused bread and wine to be brought to him , which he sent to the Duke of Orleans ; but the French Prince would neither eat nor drink . This being reported to the King , he imagined that it arose from dissatisfaction , and , therefore , went to the duke . \u2018 Noble cousin ,\u2019 said Henry , \u2018 how are you ?\u2019 \u2018 Well , my lord ,\u2019 answered the duke . \u2018 Why , then , is it ,\u2019 added the King , \u2018 that you will neither eat nor drink ?\u2019 To which Orleans replied , \u2018 that truly he had no inclination for food .\u2019 \u2018 Noble cousin ,\u2019 rejoined Henry , \u2018 be of good heart . I know that God gave me the victory over the French , not that I deserved it , but I fully believe that he wished to punish them ; and if what I have heard is true , it is not to be wondered at , for never were there greater disorder , sensuality , sins , and vices seen than now prevail in France ; which it is horrible to hear described ; and if God is provoked , it is not a subject of surprise , and no one can be astonished .\u2019 Many more conversations are said to have passed between the King and the Duke of Orleans , and the commisseration and courtesy of the former to his prisoners is mentioned by every writer in terms of just praise .\u201dThe English army , drawn up for battle ;] The victory gained at Agincourt , in the year 1415 , is , in a great measure , ascribed to the English Archers , and that there might be no want of arrows , Henry V. ordered the sheriffs of several counties to procure feathers from the wings of geese , plucking six from each goose . An archer of this time was clad in a cuirass , or a hauberk of chain-mail , with a salade on his head , which was a kind of bacinet . Every man had a good bow , a sheaf of arrows , and a sword . Fabian describes the archer \u2019 s dress at the battle of Agincourt . \u201c The yeomen had their limbs at liberty , for their hose was fastened with one point , and their jackets were easy to shoot in , so that they might draw bows of great strength , and shoot arrows a yard long .\u201d Some are described as without hats or caps , others with caps of boiled leather , or wicker work , crossed over with iron ; some without shoes , and all in a very dilapidated condition . Each bore on his shoulder a long stake , sharpened at both extremities , which he was instructed to fix obliquely before him in the ground , and thus oppose a rampart of pikes to the charge of the French Cavalry .O that we now had here But one ten thousand of those men in England That do no work to day ! ] A certain lord Walter Hungerford , knight , was regretting in the king \u2019 s presence that he had not , in addition to the small retinue which he had there , ten thousand of the best English Archers , who would be desirous of being with him ; when the King said , Thou speaketh foolishly , for , by the God of Heaven , on whose grace I have relied , and in whom I have a firm hope of victory , I would not , even if I could , increase my number by one ; for those whom I have are the people of God , whom He thinks me worthy to have at this time . Dost thou not believe the Almighty , with these his humble few , is able to conquer the haughty opposition of the French , who pride themselves on their numbers , and their own strength , as if it might be said they would do as they liked ? And in my opinion , God , of his true justice , would not bring any disaster upon one of so great confidence , as neither fell out to Judas Maccabeus until he became distrustful , and thence deservedly fell into ruin . \u2014 Nicolas \u2019 s History of Agincourt .Enter King Henry , attended . ] Henry rose with the earliest dawn , and immediately heard three masses . He was habited in his \u201c cote d \u2019 armes ,\u201d containing the arms of France and England quarterly , and wore on his bacinet a very rich crown of gold and jewels , circled like an imperial crown , that is , arched over . The earliest instance of an arched crown worn by an English monarch . \u2014 Vide Planch\u00e9 \u2019 s History of British Costume . King Henry had at Agincourt for his person five banners ; that is , the banner of the Trinity , the banner of St. George , the banner of St. Edward , the banner of St. Edmund , and the banner of his own arms . \u201c When the King of England had drawn up his order of battle he made a fine address to his troops , exhorting them to act well ; saying , that he was come into France to recover his lawful inheritance , and that he had good and just cause to claim it ; that in that quarrel they might freely and surely fight ; that they should remember that they were born in the kingdom where their fathers and mothers , wives and children , now dwelt , and therefore they ought to strive to return there with great glory and fame ; that the kings of England , his predecessors , had gained many noble battles and successes over the French ; that on that day every one should endeavour to preserve his own person and the honor of the crown of the King of England . He moreover reminded them that the French boasted they would cut off three fingers from the right hand of every archer they should take , so that their shot should never again kill man nor horse . The army cried out loudly , saying , \u2018 Sir , we pray God give you a good life , and the victory over your enemies .\u2019\u201d \u2014 Nicolas \u2019 s History of Agincourt . The banner of the Oriflamme is said to have been unfurled by the French for the last time at Agincourt .The feast of Crispian . ] The battle of Agincourt was fought upon the 25th of October , 1415 , St. Crispin \u2019 s day . The legend upon which this is founded , is as follows :\u2014 \u201c Crispinus and Crispianus were brethren , born at Rome ; from whence they travelled to Soissons in France , about the year 303 , to propagate the Christian religion ; but because they would not be chargeable to others for their maintenance , they exercised the trade of shoemakers ; but the Governor of the town , discovering them to be Christians , ordered them to be beheaded about the year 303 . From which time , the shoemakers made choice of them for their tutelar saints .\u201d \u2014 See Hall \u2019 s Chronicle .Bedford and Exeter , Warwick and Talbot , Salisbury and Gloster . ] Although Shakespeare has adhered very closely to history in many parts of Henry V ., he has deviated very much from it in the Dramatis Person\u00e6 . He makes the Duke of Bedford accompany Henry to Harfleur and Agincourt when he was Regent of England . The Earl of Exeter , or , more properly speaking , the Earl of Dorset , was left to command Harfleur ; the Earl of Westmoreland , so far from quitting England , was appointed to defend the marches of Scotland , nor does it appear that the Earl of Salisbury was either at Harfleur or Agincourt . The Earl of Warwickhad returned to England ill from Harfleur . The characters introduced in the play who really were at Agincourt , are the Dukes of Gloucester and York , and Sir Thomas Erpingham . Holinshed states that the English army consisted of 15 , 000 , and the French of 60 , 000 horse and 40 , 000 infantry \u2014 in all , 100 , 000 . Walsingham and Harding represent the English as but 9 , 000 , and other authors say that the number of French amounted to 150 , 000 . Fabian says the French were 40 , 000 , and the English only 7 , 000 . The battle lasted only three hours .How thou pleasest , Heaven , dispose the day . ] At the battle of Agincourt , having chosen a convenient spot on which to martial his men , the king sent privately two hundred archers into a low meadow , which was on one of his flanks , where they were so well secured by a deep ditch and a marsh , that the enemy could not come near them . Then he divided his infantry into three squadrons , or battles ; the van-warde , or avant-guard , composed entirely of archers ; the middle-warde , of bill-men only ; and the rerewarde , of bill-men and archers mixed together ; the horse-men , as wings , went on the flanks of each of the battles . He also caused stakes to be made of wood about five or six feet long , headed with sharp iron ; these were fixed in the ground , and the archers so placed before them that they were entirely hid from the sight of the enemy . When , therefore , the heavy cavalry of the French charged , which was done with the utmost impetuosity , under the idea of cutting down and riding over the archers , they shrunk at once behind the stakes , and the Frenchmen , unable to stop their horses , rode full upon them , so that they overthrew their riders , and caused the utmost confusion . The infantry , who were to follow up and support this charge , were so struck with amazement that they hesitated , and by this were lost , for during the panic the English archers threw back their bows , and with axes , bills , glaives , and swords , slew the French , till they met the middle-warde . The king himself , according to Speed , rode in the main battle completely armed , his shield quartering the achievements of France and England ; upon his helm he wore a coronet encircled with pearls and precious stones , and after the victory , although it had been cut and bruised , he would not suffer it to be ostentatiously exhibited to the people , but ordered all his men to give the glory to God alone . His horse was one of fierce courage , and had a bridle and furniture of goldsmiths \u2019 work , and the caparisons were most richly embroidered with the victorious ensigns of the English monarchy . Thus is he represented on his great seal , with the substitution of a knights \u2019 cap , and the crest , for the chaplet . Elmham \u2019 s account , from which this is amplified , is more particular in some of the details ; he relates , that the king appeared on a palfrey , followed by a train of led horses , ornamented with the most gorgeous trappings ; his helmet was of polished steel , surmounted with a coronet sparkling with jewels , and on his surcoat , or rather jupon , were emblazoned the arms of France and England , azure , three fleurs-de-lis or , and gules , three lion \u2019 s passant guardant or . The nobles , in like manner , were decorated with their proper armorial bearings . Before him was borne the royal standard , which was ornamented with gold and splendid colours . An account of the memorable battle of Azincourt , or Agincourt , fought on the 25th of October , 1415 , is thus related by Mr. Turner :\u2014 \u201c At dawn the King of England had matins and the mass chaunted in his army . He stationed all the horses and baggage in the village , under such small guard as he could spare , having resolved to fight the battle on foot . He sagaciously perceived that his only chance of victory rested in the superiority of the personal fortitude and activity of his countrymen , and to bring them face to face , and arm to arm , with their opponents , was the simple object of his tactical dispositions . He formed his troops into three divisions , with two wings . The centre , in which he stationed himself , he planted to act against the main body of the French , and he placed the right and left divisions , with their wings , at a small distance only from himself . He so chose his ground that the village protected his rear , and hedges and briars defended his flanks . Determined to shun no danger , but to be a conspicuous example to his troops on a day when no individual exertions could be spared , he put on a neat and shining armour , with a large and brilliant helmet , and on this he placed a crown , radiant with its jewels , and he put over him a tunic adorned with the arms of France and England . He mounted his horse , and proceeded to address his troops . The French were commanded by the Constable of France , and with him were the Dukes of Orleans , Burgundy , Berry , and Alen\u00e7on , the Marshal and Admiral of France , and a great assemblage of French nobility . Their force was divided into three great battalions , and continued formed till ten o \u2019 clock , not advancing to the attack . They were so numerous as to be able to draw up thirty deep , the English but four . A thousand speared horsemen skirmished from each of the horns of the enemy \u2019 s line , and it appeared crowded with balistae for the projection of stones of all sizes on Henry \u2019 s little army . Henry sent a part of his force behind the village of Agincourt , where the French had placed no men at arms . He moved from the rear of his army , unperceived , two hundred archers , to hide themselves in a meadow on the flank of the French advanced line . An old and experienced knight , Sir Thomas Erpingham , formed the rest into battle array for an attack , putting the archers in front , and the men at arms behind . The archers had each a sharp stake pointed at both ends , to use against the French horse . Sir Thomas having completed his formation , threw up his truncheon in the air , and dismounted . The English began the attack , which the French had awaited , not choosing to give the advantage as at Poictiers ; but when they saw them advance , they put themselves in motion , and their cavalry charged ; these were destroyed by the English archers . The French , frightened by the effect of the arrows , bent their heads to prevent them from entering the vizors of their helmets , and , pressing forward , became so wedged together as to be unable to strike . The archers threw back their bows , and , grasping their swords , battle-axes , and other weapons , cut their way to the second line . At this period the ambushed archers rushed out , and poured their impetuous and irresistable arrows into the centre of the assailed force , which fell in like manner with the first line . In short , every part successively gave way , and the English had only to kill and take prisoners .\u201dThe Duke of York commanded the van guard of the English army , and was slain in the battle . This personage is the same who appears in Shakespeare \u2019 s play of King Richard the Second by the title of Duke of Aumerle . His Christian name was Edward . He was the eldest son of Edmund Langley , Duke of York , who is introduced in the same play , and who was the fifth son of King Edward III . Richard , Earl of Cambridge , who appears in the second act of this play , was younger brother to this Edward , Duke of York .Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill :] After the battle , \u201c there were small bodies of the French on different parts of the plain , but they were soon routed , slain , or taken .\u201dEnter MONTJOY . ] Heasked Montjoye to whom the victory belonged , to him or to the King of France ? Montjoye replied that the victory was his , and could not be claimed by the King of France . The king said to the French and English heralds , \u201c It is not we who have made this great slaughter , but the omnipotent God , as we believe , for a punishment of the sins of the French . The king then asked the name of the castle he saw near him . He was told it was Agincourt . Well , then , said he , since all battles should bear the name of the fortress nearest to the spot where they were fought , this battle shall from henceforth bear the ever durable name of Agincourt .\u201d \u2014 Nicolas \u2019 s History of Agincourt .When Alen\u00e7on and myself were down together . ] During the battle , the Duke of Alen\u00e7on most valiantly broke through the English line , and advanced , fighting , near to the king , insomuch that he wounded and struck down the Duke of York . King Henry , seeing this , stepped forth to his aid , and as he was leaning down to raise him , the Duke of Alen\u00e7on gave him a blow on the helmet that struck off part of his crown . The king \u2019 s guard on this surrounded him , when , seeing he could no way escape death but by surrendering , he lifted up his arm , and said to the king , \u201c I am the Duke of Alen\u00e7on , and yield myself to you ;\u201d but as the king was holding out his hand to receive his pledge , he was put to death by the guards . \u2014 Nicolas \u2019 s History of Agincourt .Enter WARWICK and GLOSTER . ] The noble Duke of Gloucester , the king \u2019 s brother , pushing himself too vigorously on his horse into the conflict , was grievously wounded , and cast down to the earth by the blows of the French , for whose protection the king being interested , he bravely leapt against his enemies in defence of his brother , defended him with his own body , and plucked and guarded him from the raging malice of the enemy \u2019 s , sustaining perils of war scarcely possible to be borne . \u2014 Nicolas \u2019 s History of Agincourt .Here was a royal fellowship of death !\u2014] There is not much difficulty in forming a correct estimate of the numbers of the French slain at Agincourt , for if those writers who only state that from three to five thousand were killed , merely meant the men-at-arms and persons of superior rank , and which is exceedingly probable , we may at once adopt the calculation of Monstrelet , Elmham , & c ., and estimate the whole loss on the field at from ten to eleven thousand men . It is worthy of remark how very nearly the different statements on the subject approach to each other , and which can only be explained by the fact that the dead had been carefully numbered . Among the most illustrious persons slain were the Dukes of Brabant , Barr\u00e9 , and Alen\u00e7on , five counts , and a still greater proportion of distinguished knights ; and the Duke of Orleans , the Count of Vend\u00f4sme , who was taken by Sir John Cornwall , the Marshall Bouciqualt , and numerous other individuals of distinction , whose names are minutely recorded by Monstrelet , were made prisoners . The loss of the English army has been variously estimated . The discrepancies respecting the number slain on the part of the victors , form a striking contrast to the accuracy of the account of the loss of their enemies . The English writers vary in their statements from seventeen to one hundred , whilst the French chroniclers assert that from three hundred to sixteen hundred individuals fell on that occasion . St. Remy and Monstrelet assert that sixteen hundred were slain . \u2014 Nicolas \u2019 s History of Agincourt ."]}, "act_index": 34, "play_index": 3}, {"data": {"192": ["Of other lords and barons , knights and \u2019 squires ,", "Full fifteen hundred , besides common men .", "John duke of Bourbon , and lord Bouciqualt :", "But five and twenty ."]}, "act_index": 34, "play_index": 3}, {"data": {"193": ["Enough , captain : you have astonished him .", "Nay , that \u2019 s right ; but why wear you your leek today ?

CURTAIN ACT IV Supper-time in a small room at \u201c The Gascony \u201d on Derby Day . Through the windows of a broad corridor , out of which the door opens , is seen the dark blue of a summer night . The walls are of apricot-gold ; the carpets , curtains , lamp-shades , and gilded chairs , of red ; the wood-work and screens white ; the palms in gilded tubs . A doorway that has no door leads to another small room . One little table behind a screen , and one little table in the open , are set for two persons each . On a service-table , above which hangs a speaking-tube , are some dishes of hors d'ouvres , a basket of peaches , two bottles of champagne in ice-pails , and a small barrel of oysters in a gilded tub . ARNAUD , the waiter , slim , dark , quick , his face seamed with a quiet , soft irony , is opening oysters and listening to the robust joy of a distant supper-party , where a man is playing the last bars of : \u201c Do ye ken John Peel \u201d on a horn . As the sound dies away , he murmurs : \u201c Tres Joli ! \u201d and opens another oyster . Two Ladies with bare shoulders and large hats pass down the corridor . Their talk is faintly wafted in : \u201c Well , I never like Derby night ! The boys do get so bobbish ! \u201d \u201c That horn \u2014 vulgar , I call it ! \u201d ARNAUD 'S eyebrows rise , the corners of his mouth droop .

TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE ROBERT , EARL OF SUNDERLAND, PRINCIPAL SECRETARY OF STATE , ONE OF HIS MAJESTY 'S MOST HONOURABLE PRIVY-COUNCIL , & C . MY LORD , Since I cannot promise you much of poetry in my play , it is but reasonable that I should secure you from any part of it in my dedication . And indeed I cannot better distinguish the exactness of your taste from that of other men , than by the plainness and sincerity of my address . I must keep my hyperboles in reserve for men of other understandings . An hungry appetite after praise , and a strong digestion of it , will bear the grossness of that diet ; but one of so critical a judgment as your lordship , who can set the bounds of just and proper in every subject , would give me small encouragement for so bold an undertaking . I more than suspect , my lord , that you would not do common justice to yourself ; and , therefore , were I to give that character of you , which I think you truly merit , I would make my appeal from your lordship to the reader , and would justify myself from flattery by the public voice , whatever protestation you might enter to the contrary . But I find I am to take other measures with your lordship ; I am to stand upon my guard with you , and to approach you as warily as Horace did Augustus : Cui mal\u00e8 si palpere , recalcitrat undique tutus . An ill-timed , or an extravagant commendation , would not pass upon you ; but you would keep off such a dedicator at arms-end , and send him back with his encomiums to this lord , or that lady , who stood in need of such trifling merchandise . You see , my lord , what an awe you have upon me , when I dare not offer you that incense which would be acceptable to other patrons ; but am forced to curb myself from ascribing to you those honours , which even an enemy could not deny you . Yet I must confess , I never practised that virtue of moderationwith so much reluctancy as now : for it hinders me from being true to my own knowledge , in not witnessing your worth , and deprives me of the only means which I had left , to shew the world that true honour and uninterested respect which I have always paid you . I would say somewhat , if it were possible which might distinguish that veneration I have for you , from the flatteries of those who adore your fortune . But the eminence of your condition , in this particular , is my unhappiness ; for it renders whatever I would say suspected . Professions of service , submissions , and attendance , are the practice of all men to the great ; and commonly they , who have the least sincerity , perform them best ; as they , who are least engaged in love , have their tongues the freest to counterfeit a passion . For my own part , I never could shake off the rustic bashfulness which hangs upon my nature ; but , valuing myself at as little as I am worth , have been afraid to render even the common duties of respect to those who are in power . The ceremonious visits , which are generally paid on such occasions , are not my talent . They may be real even in courtiers , but they appear with such a face of interest , that a modest man would think himself in danger of having his sincerity mistaken for his design . My congratulations keep their distance , and pass no farther than my heart . There it is that I have all the joy imaginable , when I see true worth rewarded , and virtue uppermost in the world . If , therefore , there were one to whom I had the honour to be known ; and to know him so perfectly , that I could say , without flattery , he had all the depth of understanding that was requisite in an able statesman , and all that honesty which commonly is wanting ; that he was brave without vanity , and knowing without positiveness ; that he was loyal to his prince , and a lover of his country ; that his principles were full of moderation , and all his counsels such as tended to heal , and not to widen , the breaches of the nation : that in all his conversation there appeared a native candour , and a desire of doing good in all his actions : if such an one , whom I have described , were at the helm ; if he had risen by his merits , and were chosen out in the necessity and pressures of affairs , to remedy our confusions by the seasonableness of his advice , and to put a stop to our ruin , when we were just rolling downward to the precipice ; I should then congratulate the age in which I live , for the common safety ; I should not despair of the republic , though Hannibal were at the gates ; I should send up my vows for the success of such an action , as Virgil did , on the like occasion , for his patron , when he was raising up his country from the desolations of a civil war : Hunc saltem everso juvenem succurrere seclo Ne , superi , prohibete . I know not whither I am running , in this extacy which is now upon me : I am almost ready to re-assume the ancient rights of poetry ; to point out , and prophecy the man , who was born for no less an undertaking , and whom posterity shall bless for its accomplishment . Methinks , I am already taking fire from such a character , and making room for him , under a borrowed name , amongst the heroes of an epic poem . Neither could mine , or some more happy genius , want encouragement under such a patron : Pollio amat nostram , quamvis sit rustica , musam . But these are considerations afar off , my lord : the former part of the prophecy must be first accomplished ; the quiet of the nation must be secured ; and a mutual trust , betwixt prince and people , be renewed ; and then this great and good man will have leisure for the ornaments of peace ; and make our language as much indebted to his care , as the French is to the memory of their famous RichelieuYou know , my lord , how low he laid the foundations of so great a work ; that he began it with a grammar and a dictionary ; without which all those remarks and observations , which have since been made , had been performed to as little purpose , as it would be to consider the furniture of the rooms , before the contrivance of the house . Propriety must first be stated , ere any measures of elegance can be taken . Neither is one Vaugelas sufficient for such a workIt was the employment of the whole academy for many years ; for the perfect knowledge of a tongue was never attained by any single person . The court , the college , and the town , must be joined in it . And as our English is a composition of the dead and living tongues , there is required a perfect knowledge , not only of the Greek and Latin , but of the old German , the French , and the Italian ; and , to help all these , a conversation with those authors of our own , who have written with the fewest faults in prose and verse . But how barbarously we yet write and speak , your lordship knows , and I am sufficiently sensible in my own English . For I am often put to a stand , in considering whether what I write be the idiom of the tongue , or false grammar , and nonsense couched beneath that specious name of Anglicism ; and have no other way to clear my doubts , but by translating my English into Latin , and thereby trying what sense the words will bear in a more stable language . I am desirous , if it were possible , that we might all write with the same certainty of words , and purity of phrase , to which the Italians first arrived , and after them the French ; at least that we might advance so far , as our tongue is capable of such a standard . It would mortify an Englishman to consider , that from the time of Boccace and of Petrarch , the Italian has varied very little ; and that the English of Chaucer , their contemporary , is not to be understood without the help of an old dictionary . But their Goth and Vandal had the fortune to be grafted on a Roman stock ; ours has the disadvantage to be founded on the DutchWe are full of monosyllables , and those clogged with consonants , and our pronunciation is effeminate ; all which are enemies to a sounding language . It is true , that to supply our poverty , we have trafficked with our neighbour nations ; by which means we abound as much in words , as Amsterdam does in religions ; but to order them , and make them useful after their admission , is the difficulty . A greater progress has been made in this , since his majesty 's return , than , perhaps , since the conquest to his time . But the better part of the work remains unfinished ; and that which has been done already , since it has only been in the practice of some few writers , must be digested into rules and method , before it can be profitable to the general . Will your lordship give me leave to speak out at last ? and to acquaint the world , that from your encouragement and patronage , we may one day expect to speak and write a language , worthy of the English wit , and which foreigners may not disdain to learn ? Your birth , your education , your natural endowments , the former employments which you have had abroad , and that which , to the joy of good men you now exercise at home , seem all to conspire to this design : the genius of the nation seems to call you out as it were by name , to polish and adorn your native language , and to take from it the reproach of its barbarity . It is upon this encouragement that I have adventured on the following critique , which I humbly present you , together with the play ; in which , though I have not had the leisure , nor indeed the encouragement , to proceed to the principal subject of it , which is the words and thoughts that are suitable to tragedy ; yet the whole discourse has a tendency that way , and is preliminary to it . In what I have already done , I doubt not but I have contradicted some of my former opinions , in my loose essays of the like nature ; but of this , I dare affirm , that it is the fruit of my riper age and experience , and that self-love , or envy have no part in it . The application to English authors is my own , and therein , perhaps , I may have erred unknowingly ; but the foundation of the rules is reason , and the authority of those living critics who have had the honour to be known to you abroad , as well as of the ancients , who are not less of your acquaintance . Whatsoever it be , I submit it to your lordship 's judgment , from which I never will appeal , unless it be to your good nature , and your candour . If you can allow an hour of leisure to the perusal of it , I shall be fortunate that I could so long entertain you ; if not , I shall at least have the satisfaction to know , that your time was more usefully employed upon the public . I am , MY LORD , Your Lordship 's most Obedient , Humble Servant , JOHN DRYDEN . Footnotes : 1 .

Footnote : 1 . Lilburn , the most turbulent , but the boldest and most upright of men , had the merit of defying and resisting the tyranny of the king , of the parliament , and of the protector . He was convicted in the star-chamber , but liberated by the parliament ; he was tried on the parliamentary statute for treasons in 1651 , and before Cromwell 's high court of justice in 1654 ; and notwithstanding an audacious defence ,\u2014 which to some has been more perilous than a feeble cause ,\u2014 he was , in both cases , triumphantly acquitted . THE SPANISH FRIAR ; OR , THE DOUBLE DISCOVERY . Ut melius possis fallere , sume togam . \u2014 MART . \u2014 Alterna revisens Lasit , et in solido rursus fortuna locavit . \u2014 VIRG . THE SPANISH FRIAR . The Spanish Friar , or the Double Discovery , is one of the best and most popular of our poet 's dramatic efforts . The plot is , as Johnson remarks , particularly happy , for the coincidence and coalition of the tragic and comic plots . The grounds for this eminent critic 's encomium will be found to lie more deep than appears at first sight . It was , indeed , a sufficiently obvious connection , to make the gay Lorenzo an officer of the conquering army , and attached to the person of Torrismond . This expedient could hardly have escaped the invention of the most vulgar playwright , that ever dovetailed tragedy and comedy together . The felicity of Dryden 's plot , therefore , does not consist in the ingenuity of his original conception , but in the minutely artificial strokes , by which the reader is perpetually reminded of the dependence of the one part of the play on the other . These are so frequent , and appear so very natural , that the comic plot , instead of diverting our attention from the tragic business , recals it to our mind by constant and unaffected allusion . No great event happens in the higher region of the camp or court , that has not some indirect influence upon the intrigues of Lorenzo and Elvira ; and the part which the gallant is called upon to act in the revolution that winds up the tragic interest , while it is highly in character , serves to bring the catastrophe of both parts of the play under the eye of the spectator , at one and the same time . Thus much seemed necessary to explain the felicity of combination , upon which Dryden justly valued himself , and which Johnson sanctioned by his high commendation . But , although artfully conjoined , the different departments of this tragi-comedy are separate subjects of critical remark . The comic part of the Spanish Friar , as it gives the first title to the play , seems to claim our first attention . Indeed , some precedence is due to it in another point of view ; for , though the tragic scenes may be matched in All for Love , Don Sebastian , and else where , the Spanish Friar contains by far the most happy of Dryden 's comic effusions . It has , comparatively speaking , this high claim to commendation , that , although the intrigue is licentious , according to the invariable licence of the age , the language is , in general , free from the extreme and disgusting coarseness , which our author too frequently mistook for wit , or was contented to substitute in its stead . The liveliness and even brilliancy of the dialogue , shows that Dryden , from the stores of his imagination , could , when he pleased , command that essential requisite of comedy ; and that , if he has seldom succeeded , it was only because he mistook the road , or felt difficulty in travelling it . The character of Dominic is of that broadly ludicrous nature , which was proper to the old comedy . It would be difficult to show an ordinary conception more fully brought out . He is , like Falstaff , a compound of sensuality and talent , finely varied by the professional traits with which it suited the author 's purpose to adorn his character . Such an addition was , it is true , more comic than liberal ; but Dryden , whose constant dislike to the clerical order glances out in many of his performances , was not likely to be scrupulous , when called upon to pourtray one of their members in his very worst colours . To counterbalance the Friar 's scandalous propensities of every sort , and to render him an object of laughter , rather than abhorrence , the author has gifted this reprobate churchman with a large portion of wit ; by means of which , and by a ready presence of mind , always indicative of energy , he preserves an ascendence over the other characters , and escapes detection and disgrace , until poetical justice , and the conclusion of the play , called for his punishment . We have a natural indulgence for an amusing libertine ; and , I believe , that , as most readers commiserate the disgrace of Falstaff , a few may be found to wish that Dominic 's penance had been of a nature more decent and more theatrical than the poet has assigned himFrom the dedication , as well as the prologue , it appears that Dryden , however contrary to his sentiments at a future period , was , at present , among those who held up to contempt and execration the character of the Roman catholic priesthood . By one anonymous lampoon , this is ascribed to a temporary desertion of the court party , in resentment for the loss , or discontinuance of his pension . This allowance , during the pressure upon the Exchequer , was , at least , irregularly paid , of which Dryden repeatedly complains , and particularly in a letter to the Earl of Rochester . But the hardship was owing entirely to the poverty of the public purse ; and , when the anonymous libeller affirms , that Dryden 's pension was withdrawn , on account of his share in the Essay on Satire , he only shows that his veracity is on a level with his povertyThe truth seems to be , that Dryden partook in some degree of the general ferment which the discovery of the Popish Plot had excited ; and we may easily suppose him to have done so without any impeachment to his monarchial tenets , since North himself admits , that at the first opening of the plot , the chiefs of the loyal party joined in the cry . Indeed , that mysterious transaction had been investigated by none more warmly than by Danby , the king 's favourite minister , and a high favourer of the prerogative . Even when writing Absalom and Achitophel , our author by no means avows an absolute disbelief of the whole plot , while condemning the extraordinary exaggerations , by which it had been rendered the means of much bloodshed and persecutionIt seems , therefore , fair to believe , that , without either betraying or disguising his own principles , he chose , as a popular subject for the drama , an attack upon an obnoxious priesthood , whom he , in common with all the nation , believed to have been engaged in the darkest intrigues against the king and government . I am afraid that this task was the more pleasing , from that prejudice against the clergy , of all countries and religions , which , as already noticed , our author displays , in common with other wits of that licentious ageThe character of the Spanish Friar was not , however , forgotten , when Dryden became a convert to the Roman Catholic persuasion ; and , in many instances , as well as in that just quoted , it was assumed as the means of fixing upon him a charge of inconsistency in politics , and versatility in religionThe tragic part of the \u201c Spanish Friar \u201d has uncommon merit . The opening of the Drama , and the picture of a besieged town in the last extremity , is deeply impressive , while the description of the noise of the night attack , and the gradual manner in which the intelligence of its success is communicated , arrests the attention , and prepares expectation for the appearance of the hero , with all the splendour which ought to attend the principal character in tragedy . The subsequent progress of the plot is liable to a capital objection , from the facility with which the queen , amiable and virtuous , as we are bound to suppose her , consents to the murder of the old dethroned monarch . We question if the operation of any motive , however powerful , could have been pleaded with propriety , in apology for a breach of theatrical decorum , so gross , and so unnatural . But , in fact , the queen is only actuated by a sort of reflected ambition , a desire to secure to her lover a crown , which she thought in danger ; but which , according to her own statement , she only valued on his account . This is surely too remote and indirect a motive , to urge a female to so horrid a crime . There is also something vilely cold-hearted , in her attempt to turn the guilt and consequences of her own crime upon Bertran , who , whatever faults he might have to others , was to the queen no otherwise obnoxious , than because the victim of her own inconstancy . The gallant , virtuous , and enthusiastic character of Torrismond , must be allowed , in some measure , to counterbalance that of his mistress , however unhappily he has placed his affections . But the real excellence of these scenes consists less in peculiarity of character , than in the vivacity and power of the language , which , seldom sinking into vulgarity , or rising into bombast , maintains the mixture of force and dignity , best adapted to the expression of tragic passion . Upon the whole , as the comic part of this play is our author 's master-piece in comedy , the tragic plot may be ranked with his very best efforts of that kind , whether in \u201c Don Sebastian , \u201d or \u201c All for Love . \u201d The \u201c Spanish Friar \u201d appears to have been brought out shortly after Mr Thynne 's murder , which is alluded to in the Prologue , probably early in 1681-2 . The whimsical caricature , which it presented to the public , in Father Dominic , was received with rapture by the prejudiced spectators , who thought nothing could be exaggerated in the character of a Roman Catholic priest . Yet , the satire was still more severe in the first edition , and afterwards considerably softenedIt was , as Dryden himself calls it , a Protestant play ; and certainly , as Jeremy Collier somewhere says , was rare Protestant diversion , and much for the credit of the Reformation . Accordingly , the \u201c Spanish Friar \u201d was the only play prohibited by James II . after his accession ; an interdict , which may be easily believed no way disagreeable to the author , now a convert to the Roman church . It is very remarkable , that , after the Revolution , it was the first play represented by order of queen Mary , and honoured with her presence ; a choice , of which she had abundant reason to repent , as the serious part of the piece gave as much scope for malicious application against herself , as the comic against the religion of her fatherFootnotes : 1 . Collier remarks the injustice of punishing the agent of Lorenzo 's vice , while he was himself brought off with flying colours . He observes , \u201c \u2018 Tis not the fault which is corrected , but the priest . The author 's discipline is seldom without a bias . He commonly gives the laity the pleasure of an ill action , and the clergy the punishment . \u201d View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the Stage , p. 100 .", "Whose clashing points strike fire , and gild the dusk ;", "But when their force is spent and unsupplied ,", "Open your ranks , and make these madmen way ,", "First , let small parties dally with their fury ;", "So thick the prease ; so lusty are their arms ,", "The residue with mounds may be restrained ,", "Those , that reach home , from neither host are vain ,", "And therefore distant death does all the work ;", "Then close again to charge upon their backs ,", "But , wisely managed , its divided strength"]}, "act_index": 190, "play_index": 18}, {"data": {"1246": ["But young Patroclus leads his Myrmidons ,", "And in their front , even in the face of Hector ,", "A cloud of dust , that mounts in pillars upwards ,", "Resolves to dare the Trojans ."]}, "act_index": 190, "play_index": 18}, {"data": {"1247": ["Why dost thou laugh , unseasonable fool ?"]}, "act_index": 190, "play_index": 18}, {"data": {"1248": ["And keeps the best for private luxury .", "What shoals of fools one battle sweeps away !
