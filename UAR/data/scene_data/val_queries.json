The days pass by in Shadowtown Wearily , wearily ;\u2014 And Bitter-Sweet Marah of Shadowtown Sighs drearily , drearily . \u201c Mother , tell him to come to me While my hair is gold and beautiful And my lips and eyes are young While the songs that are welling up in my heart May still be sung . \u201c The days go by so wearily Like crooked goblins , eerily , Like silly shadows , fast and still , Wind-driven and drearily . \u201c Like the gray clouds are my eyes gray , mother , Like them , heavy as things grown old Only the clouds \u2019 tears are but dream-tears \u2014 Lifeless , cold . \u201c Last night I had the strangest dream ,\u2014 It seemed I stood on a barren hill Where the wings of the ragged clouds went by Hurrying and still . \u201c And all of a sudden the moon came out Making a pathway over the down ,\u2014 And turned my hair to a gold mist , mother , To light the way to Shadowtown . \u201c But when I did not see him coming , And because the clouds grew dark and gray I walked through the shadows down the hillside To help him better to find the way . \u201c And in some wise I came to a forest When all around was so strange and dim ,\u2014 That I thought , \u2018 If I should be lost in the darkness , How could my hair be light for him ? \u2019 \u201c But groping , I found I was on a pathway Where low soft branches swept my face ,\u2014 When suddenly , close beside , and before me I knew dim forms kept even pace . \u201c They were so cowering , shivering , white That I felt some ill thing came behind And I heard a moan on the wind go by \u2018 Ah , but the end of the path to find ! \u2019 \u201c Then I looked behind , and saw that near Like a wan marsh-fog , came a cloud Hurrying on ,\u2014 and I knew it wrapped A dead love \u2014 as a shroud . \u201c And guiltily the figures went , Like coward things in a guilty race And not one dared to look behind For fear he knew that dead love 's face . \u201c Then suddenly at my side I knew He I loved went ;\u2014 but , for my hair , Shadowed and blown about my face , He knew me not beside him there . \u201c And he , too , cowered with shaking hands Over his eyes , for fear to meet Haunting and still , my pallid face In that strange mist of winding-sheet . \u201c So on the shadowy figures went Hurrying the loathed cloud before ,\u2014 Seeking an end of a fated path That went winding evermore . \u201c Oh , Mother , that path was hideous ,\u2014 Long and ill and hideous \u2014 And the way was so near to Shadowtown ,\u2014 Fairer to Shadowtown \u2014 But the gold of my hair shall not light the way For anyone else to Shadowtown . \u201d Gray-eyed Marah of Shadowtown Turns away wearily , wearily Weaving her gold hair back and forth , Thus she sings , and drearily \u2014 \u201c Little Love , when you shall die , then so shall I , Ha , merrily ! \u201c Then let them put us in some deep spot Where one the growing of trees \u2019 roots hears And you at my heart , all wet with tears , All wet with tears . \u201c Your wings are draggled and limp and wet ,\u2014 Little Love ,\u2014 From what rainy land have you come , and far ,\u2014 Or who that has held you was crying so ,\u2014 Who , little Love \u2014? My eyes are heavy and wet with tears Whose eyes besides are heavy so \u2014? \u2014 Oh , little Love , how dumb you are !\u2014 \u201c Then , poor Love , that has lived in my heart Come , take my hand , we will go together , Hemlock boughs are full of sleep Out of the way of the weather . \u201c For a cavern of cold gray mist is my heart Will not the hemlock boughs be better Over our feet and under our heads Keeping us from the weather ? \u201d Her gold hair duskily glints in her hands Marah of Shadowtown sings \u2014 \u201c Together ,\u2014 You , little Love , and I , will go Into the Land of Pleasanter Weather . \u201d Anne Throop . DIES IRAE . Go fight your fight with Tagal and with Boer , Cheer in the lust of strength and brutal pride ; Beat down the lamb to fatten up the fox , Shout victory o'er the prostrate shape of truth . Take cross and pike and gold and sophistry , To pray and prod and purchase , wheedle , wile ; Stamp out the roses in a waste of weeds , Shout while the trembling voice of truth is hushed . Shatter with iron heel the poet 's dream , The prophet 's protest , and the ages \u2019 hope , Of brotherhood and light and love on earth \u2014 Of peace and plenty and a perfect race . Tear down the fabric of ten thousand years , The world 's best wisdom woven in its woe ; Lift ruthless hands to rend the fairy fane That holds the heart hopes of humanity . Let loose greed , envy , lust , and avarice , The myriad throated dragon of desire ; Let might rule , riot , batten on the meek , The tyranny of man o'er man seem right . Forget the Lord Christ smiled , forgave , and died ; Frowned down every appeal to brutish strength ; Bade man put up the sword , lest by the sword He perish ; prayed evil might be paid by good . Forget he turned cheek to the coward blow , Cried \u201c Pardon ! \u201d yes , seven and seventy times ! \u201c Judge not ; Do not condemn ; give coat as well as cloak ; Resist not evil , wrong 's not made right by wrong . \u201d Forget each drop of blood burns in the race , Cries for atonement while the last man lives ; That murder for the state is murder still , The gilded not less guilty though more great . Forget , and flay and flame ; in din grow deaf To piteous cries without , and voice within ; Conquer , triumph , and when the world is won , Turn terroring towards the demon in your heart . William Mountain . GEORGE MEREDITH ON THE SOURCE OF DESTINY . If , as has so often been said , literature is an expression of life , surely we may study literature to discover the laws of life . Not all our writers , but all our masters , have given us records from which we may learn what has been discerned and accepted concerning life by the race . The scientific study of our day has led men to consider genius from the modern point of view . Is genius a natural product ? If so , whence comes it , and what are its laws ? These are among the most interesting questions of the present time . Formerly , men contented themselves with calling the literary faculty a \u201c gift , \u201d the result of \u201c inspiration . \u201d Of late we have been told that it is a natural race impulse which finds expression in some individual . Personally , we believe genius to be the heated , pregnant condition of a great mind under the influence of a great enthusiasm . However our definitions of genius may differ , on one point we all agree . We are all sure that genius is true to life , that genius teaches us the truth . In its formed philosophical theories it may err , but not in its perceptions of life . Shelley may teach atheistic views in \u2018 Queen Mab , \u2019 and he may err , for intellectual belief is a matter of opinion . Nevertheless Shelley 's inspired interpretation of life can but be accepted as real . George Meredith may teach in his \u2018 Lord Ormond and his Aminta \u2019 doctrines of free love , resulting from an attempt to separate what can not be separated in our human lives ,\u2014 the physical and the spiritual loves ; and in doing this he may err . Nevertheless , in his inspired representations of life and character , coming not from thought alone but from his whole nature , Meredith cannot err . Those of us who read thoughtlessly , without formed theory , accept literature as real . Have you never , when asked : \u201c Did you ever know of a case of love at first sight ? \u201d answered carelessly : \u201c Oh , yes ! There 's Romeo and Juliet , you know ? \u201d Or have you never instanced , as the most persuasive oration you ever heard , Mark Antony 's speech in \u2018 Julius Caesar ? \u2019 Thinkers who claim a natural mental origin for the literary gift must believe in its reality as a matter of course . Those who speak reverently of its \u201c inspiration \u201d claim a spirit of truth , not of error , for its parent . Even those who enjoy comparisons of the states of genius and insanity , ranging from Shakespeare , with his words : \u201c The fool , the lover , and the poet are of imagination all compact \u201d to the masterly modern treatment of John Fiske , agree that the sharp division line of truth and error separates the two . They confess that while the insane mind may accept hallucinations , the mind of genius deals only with the truth . The results of both are imaginative ; only those of insanity are imaginary . All thinkers , then , accept the masterpieces of literature as among life 's real phenomena . Whether Meredith 's novels hold this high place is at present a matter of opinion . For men do not know Meredith very well . A knowledge of his position on this question of Destiny will help us to learn whether or not he ranks among the elect . In our great literature there has always appeared a close sequence between wisdom and success , righteousness and happiness , and , on the other hand , between the choice of moral evil and suffering . This sequence has been not merely expressed in words , but built into the very structure of the plot through the workings of the imagination kindled by genius . The law of this succession , and its relationship with other laws , philosophers have always been seeking . It is this search that has led men into the mazy discussions of freedom and fatalism . For in this law lies the crucial point of the question of human destiny . \u2018 Beowulf , \u2019 our first epic , tells us not only much of the manner of life of our rude Saxon ancestors , but also much of their thought . The note of fatalism in its chord of life is no weak one . \u201c A man must bear his fate , \u201d the hero says when about to go into a dangerous combat . Yet even in \u2018 Beowulf \u2019 we find the contrasting element , the character choice appearing . As a child boldly states a problem as though it were a solution , Beowulf naively says : \u201c Fate always aids the undoomed man , if his courage holds out . \u201d This expression side by side of the two elements of the question has never been surpassed , and is , in its way , matchless . Have we learned much more to-day ? We cannot fail to recognize the duality of the truth , but have we been able yet to join the two sides into one , to discover the unity that surely lies behind the seeming contrast ? Each side of the question has been largely developed . Some , in a narrow spirit , have echoed merely Beowulf 's , \u201c Fate always aids the undoomed man \u201d ; while others , often as narrowly , have answered , \u201c A man succeeds , if his courage holds out . \u201d Ever in our greatest literature the two elements have appeared side by side . The mystery has always been recognized . That even Shakespeare is reverent before fate , yet believes in the influence of character on a man 's life can easily be seen from words like Helena 's in \u2018 All 's Well that Ends Well ':\u2014 \u201c Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie Which we ascribe to heaven ; the fated sky Gives us free scope , only doth backward pull Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull . \u201d \u2018 Macbeth , \u2019 with its successive steps of unhappiness following one critical evil choice is sufficient proof of Shakespear 's belief in the determining power of character . \u2018 King Lear , \u2019 with its sad result of folly shows his belief in the influence of the critical foolish decision .

Jephthah is pilloried in history as the man who sacrificed his daughter in payment for his worldly success . Shakespeare also refers to him in \u2018 3 Henry VI , \u2019 v , 1 , 91 : \u201c To keep that oath were more impiety than Jephthah 's when he sacrificed his daughter . \u201d Hamlet dubs Polonius \u201c Jephthah , \u201d because he believes that he has paid for political preferment by yielding his daughter to the King . And when Polonius says that , if he is to be called Jephthah , he admits that like Jephthah he loves his daughter , Hamlet replies in characteristic vein , \u201c Nay , that follows not \u201d ; meaning that it follows instead that like Jephthah he has sacrificed her . But when Polonius presses him to say what does follow , he conceals his real meaning , as his custom is , and diverts the old man 's mind by answering the line from the ballad . As was the case with regard to Ophelia , Hamlet is reluctant to make the open charge against her father . Thus in every instance in which Hamlet comes in contact with Ophelia , or refers to her , his actions and his words consistently point to the fact that he renounces her because he believes her to have thrust him aside while engaging in an intrigue with the King . And the fact that from this point of view there is a connected story of their relations told by the several interviews above discussed , that Hamlet 's conduct and language in them all are adequately explained , and that a single belief of his accounts for each of them , is strong confirmation of the theory 's correctness . It is in harmony with the general scheme of the drama also , all of whose important movements hinge on \u201c purposes mistook \u201d ; and it furnishes Hamlet with an adequate motive for his treatment of Ophelia , and removes from him the stigma of mere brutishness or insanity . Coleridge well says that there must have been \u201c some profound heart truth \u201d under the story , and the theory herein advanced seems to disclose it . David A. McKnight . Washington , D. C ., February 26 , 1898 . CLEWS TO EMERSON 'S MYSTIC VERSE .\u201c When a man 's verses cannot be understood , nor a man 's good wit seconded with the forward child understanding , it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room . \u201d \u2014 Touchstone . The phantasmal lords of life of the poem \u2018 Experience , \u2019 which we considered at the close of the last paper , were presumably suggested to Emerson by the following lines from Tennyson 's \u2018 Mystic , \u2019 published in 1830\u2014 \u201c Always there stood before him , night and day , Of wayward vary-colored circumstance The imperishable presences serene , Colossal , without form , or sense , or sound , Dim shadows but unwaning presences Four-faced to four corners of the sky . \u201d The \u201c silent congregated hours , \u201d \u201c daughters of time , divinely tall , \u201d with \u201c severe and youthful brows , \u201d in this same poem of Tennyson gave Emerson his \u201c daughters of Time , the hypocritic Days , \u201d congregated in procession . Tennyson 's mystic , who hears \u201c time flowing in the middle of the night \u201d recalls Emerson 's \u2018 Two Rivers , \u2019 in which the living All , the Infinite Soul , is figured as a stream flowing through eternity :\u2014 \u201c I hear the spending of the stream , Through years , through men , through nature fleet , Through love and thought , through power and dream . \u201d At the close of the poem \u2018 Wealth \u2019 there is a bit of scientific nature-ethics which is a little obscure . The greater part of the poem is a series of graphic pictures , detailing the process of world-development through the geologic ages down to the advent of man . Suddenly , at the end ,\u2014 just as at the end of the prose essay on the same subject ,\u2014 he remembers his manners and makes his bow to the august Soul , kindles a light in the Geissler tube of nature , sets it aglow interiorly with spiritual law :\u2014 \u201c But , though light-headed man forget , Remembering Matter pays her debt : Still , through her motes and masses , draw Electric thrills and ties of Law , Which bind the strength of Nature wild To the conscience of a child . \u201d The logical link connecting this part with the rest has dropped out in the poem , but is clear enough in the essay . The lines mean simply this : that , though man may forget to obey the laws of the universe , Nature never forgets her debt of obedience ; she bites and stings the transgressor and caresses and soothes him who obeys . In her own submission to law she has that artlessness and quasi-moral sense that affines her to the moral nature of a child . The \u201c awful victors \u201d and \u201c Eternal Rights \u201d of \u2018 Voluntaries \u2019 are only \u201c remembering Matter \u201d in another mask : with all their innocent obedience they are themselves terrible executors :\u2014 \u201c They reach no term , they never sleep , In equal strength through space abide ; Though , feigning dwarfs , they crouch and creep , The strong they slay , the swift outstride . \u201d In the following high pantheistic strain the seer chants the old rune that God is all :\u2014 \u201c The living Heaven thy prayers respect , House at once and architect , Quarrying man 's rejected hours , Builds therewith eternal towers ; Sole and self-commanded works , Fears not undermining days , Grows by decays , And , by the famous might that lurks In reaction and recoil , Makes flame to freeze and ice to boil ; Forging , through swart arms of Offence , The silver seat of Innocence . \u201d \u2014 \u2018 Spiritual Laws . \u2019 When the Living Universe builds a house , it builds it out of its own soul substance ; while man sleeps and loiters , the Unconscious ceaselessly toils . In the phrase \u201c grows by decays , \u201d Emerson embodies , I believe , the law of the conservation of energy . The magazine of divine power is exhaustless ; does energy sink out of sight here , it is only to reappear yonder ; the tree decays , but out of its fertilizing substance new plants may spring up ; the coal under the steam boiler of the locomotive is consumed , but the swart goblin has lost no whit of his might : he just slips darkling up into the steam , makes the driving-rods his swift-shuttling arms , and , grasping with his steel fingers the felloes of the wheel , whirls you half a thousand miles over the green bulge of the earth ere set of sun , The mystic Power grows by decays ; and also , by \u201c the famous might that lurks in reaction and recoil , \u201d reconciles apparent antinomies and opposites , and is the agent that visits evil upon the head of the evil doer and mercy upon the merciful . If a heavy body be rolled up an inclined plane , it acquires potential and kinetic energy just equal to the force expended in getting it there , and in reaction develops such a famous might that , if massive enough , it will knock you down if you stand in its way . If you lift the big pendulum of the clock in the corner , you also confer latent , or reactionary , energy upon it . Only it is of course hyperbolical for the poet to say that reaction is potent enough to actually freeze flame and make ice boil your kettle . That is only one of Emerson 's rhetorical Chinese crackers , his startling thaumaturgic way of illustrating his thesis . The key-thought of the essay \u2018 Spiritual Laws , \u2019 to which the occult lines we are considering were prefixed , is , Be noble ; for , if you are not , your face and life will , by the law of reaction and return , publish your lapse . Punishment and reward are fruits that ripen unsuspected in the deeds of men . The pertinency and application of many of Emerson 's titles are not at once apparent . In \u2018 Merops \u2019 the bard affirms that in his high philosophical soarings he cares not whether he can at once ticket his intuitions and perceptions with names or not . Merops was changed into an eagle , says Ovid , and placed among the constellations ,\u2014 hence , I suppose , is selected by Emerson as a good type of the kind of soaring thinker he is describing . That he also has in mind that Merops was the putative father of Phaethon is shown perhaps by the allusionto Phaethon 's mishap :\u2014 \u201c Space grants beyond his fated road No inch to the god of day , And copious language still bestowed One word , no more , to say . \u201d \u2018 Alphonso of Castile \u2019 is a dramatic monologue containing a whimsical suggestion for compounding a Man out of ordinary weak-timbered manikins by killing nine in ten of them and \u201c stuffing nine brains in one hat . \u201d It is put into the mouth of Alphonso , King of Castile , born in 1221 , called El Sabio , \u201c The Wise . \u201d He was a man who suffered much in his life . He wrote a famous code of laws , and first made the Castilian a national language by causing the Bible to be translated into it . Emerson chooses him as the vehicle of his own whimsey about the condensed homunculus chiefly on account of one famous sentence attributed to him : \u201c Had I been present at the creation , I could have given some useful hints for the better ordering of the universe . \u201d Emerson , in his rhymed soliloquy , put into Alphonso 's mouth , sarcastically twits Nature with her depleted stocks , her run-out strains of lemons , figs , roses , and men . The remedy proposed in the case of man , and outlined above , has the true Emerson-Swift bouquet , is colored and veined with a right Shakespearian scorn of the mob . \u2018 Mithridates \u2019 is a monologue put into the mouth of Mithridates the Great , King of Pontus , who is said to have discovered an antidote for poisons which made him poison-proof against his many enemies :\u2014 \u201c I cannot spare water or wine , Tobacco-leaf , or poppy , or rose ; From the earth-poles to the line , All between that works or grows , Everything is kin of mine . Give me agates for my meat ; Give me cantharids to eat ; From air and ocean bring me foods , From all zones and altitudes . \u201d As late as 1787 \u201c mithridate \u201d was the name for an antidote against poison included in the London pharmacopia . In Jonson 's \u2018 Every Man in his Humour , \u2019 Kitely , thinking he is poisoned , calls for mithridate and oil . It was composed of many ingredients and given in the form of electuaries . In our modern pharmacopoeias we have plenty of antidotes against virulent poisons ; e. g ., atropine for the deadly amanita mushroom . And counter-poisons are often used , as the tincture of foxglove for aconite , atropine for morphia , or morphia for belladonna . According to the tradition , Mithridates gradually inured his system to counter-poisons , and became poison-proof . At any rate , Emerson uses him for his metaphor , which , in untropical speech , is this : \u201c lam tired of the nambypamby and goody-goody ; give me things strong and rank ; give me evil for a change and a spur . \u201c Too long shut in strait and few , Thinly dieted on dew , I will use the world , and sift it , To a thousand humors shift it , As you spin a cherry . O doleful ghosts and goblins merry ! O all you virtues , methods , mights , Means , appliances , delights , Reputed wrongs and braggart rights , Smug routine , and things allowed , Minorities , things under cloud ! Hither ! take me , use me , fill me , Vein and artery , though ye kill me ! \u201d In brief , \u201c I have run the gauntlet of experience , sounded all the depths of passion , joy , woe , evil . I am dipped in Styx , more invulnerable than Siegfried , and strong now to use the world and be used by it . \u201d The mood of the poem is the wild longing that sometimes comes over the good man to break loose and have his fling , come what may , cry , Vive la bagatelle ! or run amuck and tilt at all he meets . It is needless to say that the staid Emerson never carried this mood farther than to smoke a cigar now and then , or take an Adirondack outing . His contemporary , the untrammelled Whitman , could both preach and practisethe Mithridatic doctrine ; and he was a more many-sided and symmetrical man in consequence . The last two lines of \u2018 Mithridates , \u2019 as printed from the autograph copy , were ,\u2014 \u201c God ! I will not be an owl , But sun me in the Capitol . \u201d These lines Emerson wisely dropped . \u2018 Forerunners \u2019\" mean one 's brave hopes and ideals of good to come , our dreams and aspirations . The lines \u201c No speed of mine avails To hunt upon their shining trails \u201d Thoreau evidently utilized as text for his well-known fable in \u2018 Walden \u2019 of the lost hound , bay horse , and turtle-dove . The portrait of Hermione , the patient-sweet wife of Leontes in \u2018 The Winter 's Tale \u2019 of Shakespeare , serves Emerson , in his poem \u2018 Hermione , \u2019 as the model of a perfect wife , and a more acceptable one to this age than Chaucer 's abject Griselda . Such a lady as Shakespeare 's Hermione , beautiful in person and of rare self-control and virtue , is an adumbration or epitome of the universal beauty . Looking at nature , the American poet finds the features of his Hermione there : \u201c mountains and the misty plains , Her colossal portraiture . \u201d I suppose that this sketch , tender and delicately toned as if with a silver point , is autobiographical , and is a shadowing forth of the character of Emerson 's first wife , the ethereal souled Ellen Tucker , who died of consumption after only a year and a half of married life . When her \u201c meteor glances came , \u201d he says , he was \u201c hermit vowed to books and gloom , \u201d and dwelling alone . In the lines \u201c The chains of kind The distant bind ; Deed thou doest she must do , \u201d he anticipatesthe telepathy of our days ,\u2014 kindred minds seeking similar places and thinking like thoughts , although in this case , to be sure , the kindred soul is thought of as merged with the inorganic world ,\u2014 the winds and waterfalls and twilight nooks . Search the whole world through , you shall find no predecessor of Emerson the poet . The only verse resembling his in general style is that of the enigmatic \u2018 Phoenix and the Turtle , \u2019 attributed to Shakespeare , and much admired by Emerson :\u2014 \u201c Let the bird of loudest lay , On the sole Arabian tree . Herald sad and trumpet be , To whose sound chaste wings obey . \u201d Emerson 's verses have also a slight Persian tinge now and then , caught from his studies of Saadi and Hafiz . In his fine lyric cry \u2018 Bacchus , \u2019 in which he calls for a wine of life , a cup of divine soma or amrita , that shall sinew his brain and exalt all his powers of thought and action to a godlike pitch ,\u2014 \u201c Bring me wine , but wine which never grew In the belly of the grape , That I intoxicated , And by the draught assimilated , May float at pleasure through all natures ; Quickened so , will I unlock Every crypt of every rock , \u201d \u2014 he unconsciously gave his lines , I think , the outward form of some verses by Hafiz , in which that singer intimates that , give him the right kind of wine , and he can perform wonders as if with Solomon 's ring or Jemschid 's wine-cup mirror . Emerson himself in one of his early editions gives a spirited verse translation of Hafiz 's poem . Mr. William R. Algertranslates Hafiz thus :\u2014 \u201c Bring me wine ! By my puissant arm The thick net of deceit and of harm Which the priests have spread over the world Shall be rent and in laughter be hurled . Bring me wine ! I the earth will subdue . Bring me wine ! I the heaven will storm through . Bring me wine , bring it quick , make no halt ! To the throne of both worlds will I vault . All is in the red streamlet divine . Bring me wine ! O my host , bring me wine ! \u201d \u2018 Etienne de la Boece \u2019 gets its titlefrom the name of one of Montaigne 's most intimate friends ,\u2014 Estienne de la Boetie . Montaigne tells us about him in Chapter xxvii of his Essays , affirming that he would have accomplished miracles , had he lived . He died when only thirty-three at BordeauxHis scholarship was solid , his translations from the Greek excellent . He was so eager to read Greek that he copied whole volumes with his own hand . A French critic says , \u201c Les qualites qui brillaient en lui imprimaient a toute sa personne un cachet distingue et un charme severe . \u201d Yet he seems to have been something of an imitator of his great friend ; and it is in this aspect of his life that Emerson regards him , using him , perhaps somewhat unjustly to his powers and developing genius , as the type of a too imitative disciple :\u2014 \u201c I serve you not , if you I follow , Shadowlike , o'er hill and hollow ; Vainly valiant , you have missed The manhood that should yours resist . \u201d Probably most Americans , if asked to explain the relevancy of the title of Emerson 's poem \u2018 Guy , \u2019 would be unable to answer offhand . The verses celebrate the lucky man :\u2014 \u201c The common waters fell As costly wine into his well . The zephyr in his garden rolled From plum-trees vegetable gold . Stream could not so perversely wind But corn of Guy 's was there to grind . \u201d The reference , of course , is to a man well known in England ,\u2014 Thomas Guy, founder of Guy 's Hospital in London . He was the George Peabody of his day . Beginning life as a bookseller , he made a good deal of money in printing Bibles , but acquired most of his enormous fortune by financial speculations . He was extremely economical ; for example , always ate his dinner on his shop counter , first spreading out a newspaper to catch the crumbs . His charities were boundless . To his hospital he gave $ 1 , 000 , 000 ; and at his death his will was found to contain an enormous number of special benefactions , including bequests to over ninety cousins . Emerson in his poem compares Guy to Polycrates , who was King of Samos some five hundred years before Christ . He says that Polycrates \u201c chained the sunshine and the breeze \u201d ; that is , the very elements seemed to be in his pay . This run of luck was without a break up to his death ; his fleet of a hundred ships was the largest then known ; he conquered all his enemies , and amassed great treasure . His ally , Amasis , King of Egypt , was so alarmed at his prosperity , fearing the envy of the gods , that he advised him to make some noteworthy sacrifice . The story goes that Polycrates accordingly threw his emerald signet-ring into the sea , but it came back to his kitchens in the belly of a large fish , as in the Arabian Nights story . The fears of Amasis were finally justified ; for the Persian satrap Ortes enticed Polycrates to the mainland , and crucified him . \u2018 Xenophanes \u2019 embodies poetically the doctrine of the earnest old Greek agnostic and monist of that name , that God , or the All , is uncreated , immovable , and one ,\u2014 not immovable in its parts , but as a whole , and just because it is all . Xenophanes saw the grandeur and incomprehensibility of the universe , he violently opposed what seemed to him the disgraceful polytheism of Homer , and anticipated the modern atomic theory and the doctrine of the unity of life as revealed by the spectroscope and the discovery of the conservation and mutual convertibility of forces . Or , as Emerson puts it in his haunting numbers ,\u2014 \u201c By fate , not option , frugal Nature gave One scent to hyson and to wall-flower , One sound to pine-groves and to waterfalls , One aspect to the desert and the lake . It was her stern necessity . \u201d The title of the poem \u2018 Hamatreya \u2019 seemed at first to baffle a perfect and indubitable explanation . The word can be found in no English or foreign dictionary that the largest libraries afford . We are indebted , however , to Col. T. W. Higginsonfor not only giving us a clew to the title , but for pointing out the portion of the Vishnu Puranaon which Emerson based his \u2018 Earth Song \u2019 in \u2018 Hamatreya , \u2019 and , in fact , got the hint for the whole poem ; namely , at the close of Book IV . Maitreya is a disciple of Parasara , who relates to Maitreya the Vishnu Purana . Among other things he tells Maitreya of a chant of the Earth , who said , \u201c When I hear a king sending word to another by his ambassador , \u2018 This earth is mine : immediately resign your pretensions to it , \u2019 I am moved to violent laughter at first ; but it soon subsides in pity for the infatuated fool . \u201d Again , the Purana says , \u201c Earth laughs , as if smiling with autumnal flowers , to behold her kings unable to effect the subjugation of themselves \u201d ; which is Emerson 's \u201c Earth laughs in flowers , to see her boastful boys Earth-proud , proud of the earth which is not theirs . \u201d", "For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog , being a god kissing carrion \u2014 Have you a daughter ?", "I never gave you aught .", "Nay , that follows not .", "Let her not walk i \u2019 the sun . Conception is a blessing , but not as your daughter may conceive . Friend , look to it .", "Ha , ha ! are you honest ?"]}, "act_index": 90, "play_index": 10}, {"data": {"539": ["Honest , my lord ?", "That 's very true , my lord .", "How say you by that ? Still harping on my daughter . Yet he knew me not at first ; he said I was a fishmonger . He is far gone , far gone . \u201dThere has been much discussion of this passage , but no satisfactory solution of it . It is a good sample of the enigmatic style of speech characteristic of Hamlet , which presumably the audiences of Shakespeare 's day comprehended , which of course the astute Polonius did not understand , and which puzzles later generations because they have lost the ancient significance of certain words . Polonius is so prejudiced in favor of his theory that it was \u201c the very ecstacy of love \u201d that troubled Hamlet , that he does not even attempt to fathom his allusions . And yet Hamlet 's last remark , warning him about his daughter , rivets his attention , and he demands to know what is meant by it ; but it is only for an instant , his illusion again diverts him from the matter , and the chance of explanation thus escapes . Malone says that \u201c fishmonger \u201d was a cant term for a \u201c wencher \u201d ; and in Barnabe Rich 's \u2018 Irish Hubbub \u2019 is the expression \u201c senex fornicator , an old fishmonger . \u201d Possibly this is its primary significance in Hamlet 's mind , for shortly afterwards he satirically says of Polonius to the players : \u201c He 's for a jig , or a tale of bawdry , or he sleeps . \u201d In several instances Shakespeare similarly alludes to \u201c fishing \u201d ; as in \u2018 Measure for Measure , \u2019 i , 2 , 91 : \u201c Groping for trouts in a peculiar river \u201d ; \u2018 Winter 's Tale , \u2019 i , 2 , 195 : \u201c And his pond fish 'd by his next neighbor \u201d ; and possibly in \u2018 Antony and Cleopatra , \u2019 i , 4 , 4 : \u201c He fishes , drinks , and wastes the lamps of night in revels . \u201d The word \u201c monger \u201d in compound words , as used by Shakespeare , does not always mean a trader in the article , but sometimes one who merely indulges in the act ; as in \u2018 Love 's Labour 's Lost , \u2019 ii , 1 , 253 : \u201c Thou art an old love-monger \u201d ; in \u2018 Romeo and Juliet , \u2019 ii , 4 , 30 : \u201c These strange flies , these fashion-mongers \u201d ; and in \u2018 Measure for Measure , \u2019 v , 1 , 337 : \u201c Was the Duke a fleshmonger ? \u201d In common usage the word has this double significance , indeed , dependent upon whether its adjunct refers to a thing or to an act ; as , for example , cheesemonger and scandalmonger , and other similar compounds which will readily suggest themselves . Hence \u201c fishmonger \u201d means both one given to \u201c fishing \u201d and a trader in fish . And doubtless the latter is its most important significance in Hamlet 's mind , when Polonius denies that he is a fishmonger , namely that he is a trader in a food which from time immemorial has been supposed to be an aphrodisiac . Wherefore we are to understand Hamlet as meaning that Polonius is not so honest a man as the fishmonger that Polonius has in mind , or the senex fornicator that he originally had in mind , but that he is a fleshmonger ,\u2014 a pander , as Tieck puts it ;\u2014 \u201c traders in flesh \u201d such persons are termed in \u2018 Troilus and Cressida , \u2019 v , 11 , 46 . It is supposed by Tieck that the allusion is to the way in which Polonius threw Hamlet and Ophelia together , by Friesen that it refers to his pandering to the desires of Claudius and the Queen before the old King 's death , and by Doering that it points to his promotion of the o'erhYpppHeNhasty marriage of the King and Queen . But the foregoing discussion shows that the secondary thought in Hamlet 's mind is that for some personal end Polonius permits Ophelia to accept the King 's attentions , knowing the necessary effect of her youth and beauty on his licentious nature ; for at his last interview with her he saw her father also , though apparently hiding from both of them , and therefore believes that he was cognizant of the fact that she had gone to the palace privately to meet the King . It is evidently this belief which inspires him with the contempt which he afterwards exhibits towards Polonius . His next speech manifests this contempt in a notable degree , but it has been unappreciated because of the failure to perceive the significance of the word \u201c sun . \u201d It is an argument intended to enforce what he had already said , and , supplying the omitted portion , the whole runs thus : You are not honest , and you cannot be honest ; \u201c for if the sunbreed maggots in a dead dog , being agod kissing carrion , \u201d even so will the sun of this realmengender misdeeds in you , a corrupt man caressed by an earthly god . In characteristic fashion Shakespeare uses \u201c sun \u201d in a double sense , as he has just used \u201c fishmonger , \u201d and again the occult reference is to Polonius as a procurer for the King . And Hamlet follows this up by the warning concerning Ophelia ; \u201c Let her not walk i \u2019 the sun; conception is a blessing , but not as your daughter may conceive\" \u201c Sun \u201d in this passage means \u201c sunshine \u201d or \u201c sunlight , \u201d as in ordinary usage it often does , but it is the light of the sun of royalty that he has just mentioned . Hamlet 's meaning is made so plain by this construction , that it scarcely needs argument to enforce it . It may however be remarked that , assuming its correctness in respect of the declaration that Polonius is not so honest as a fishmonger , its correctness as to the sun 's breeding maggots in carrion and causing conception in Ophelia necessarily follows . The three enigmatical statements , thus interpreted , complement and explain each other , and therefore tend to prove each other ; and the proof is strengthened by the fact that they are the sequelae of a single thought , namely , his belief in an intrigue between Ophelia and the King . On the other hand , conceding such a belief , a man of Hamlet 's character would most naturally think these thoughts , and utter them in characteristic style to Ophelia 's father :\u2014 The King breeds corruption in you as does the sun in a carrion dog , you are risking your daughter 's honor to win his favor , and the experiment will probably end in her dishonor . Hence Hamlet 's alleged belief , deduced from his three interviews with Ophelia , and these three resulting comments tend to prove each other 's correctness . Again , the sun is plainly credited by Hamlet with a double function , namely , corruptly breeding life in a dead dog and in a living woman , and the only possible means of harmonizing the two \u2019 statements , and of making sense out of the latter , is to assume that some man is typified by the second sun . It is generally admitted that an uncompleted argument is introduced by the particle \u201c for , \u201d and , such being the case , it is a fair assumption that that also shall contain a reference to \u201c the sun \u201d as doing something which a man may do . On such an assumption , the argument is readily followed up : \u201c For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog , \u201d so must \u201c the sun \u201d breed dishonesty in you , and so may \u201c the sun \u201d cause your daughter to conceive . These three propositions are consistent , the logical connection between them is perfect , and their reason and purpose is clear , if the term \u201c sun \u201d may figuratively indicate \u201c the King . \u201d Now , it is to be observed that Shakespeare not infrequently refers to kings as suns , and likens them to gods . When the King has pardoned her son , the Duchess of York exclaims : \u201c A god on earth thou art \u201d ; \u2018 Richard II , \u2019 v , 3 , 136 . \u201c Kings are earth 's gods , \u201d says Pericles ; \u2018 Pericles , \u2019 i , 1 , 103 . And again he says of the King , his father , that he \u201c Had princes sit like stars about his throne , And he the sun , for them to reverence , \u201d Ibid ., II , iii , 40 , In \u2018 Henry VIII , \u2019 i , 1 , 6 , Buckingham , referring to the meeting of the Kings of England and France on the Field of the Cloth of Gold , styles them \u201c Those suns of glory , those two lights of men . \u201d And Norfolk tells of the wondrous deeds done there , \u201c when these sunsby their heralds challenged The noble spirits to arms \u201d ; Ibid ., i , 1 , 33 . Again , adverting to the manner in which Cardinal Woolsey overshadows all other men in the King 's favor , Buckingham says : \u201c I wonder That such a keech can with his very bulk Take up the rays o \u2019 th \u2019 beneficial sun , And keep it from the earth \u201d ; Ibid ., i , 1 , 56 . When the Cardinal has procured the King to arrest him , Buckingham foresees his speedy death , and again uses this metaphor in a passage which has been much misunderstood , Ibid ., i . 1 , 236 : \u201c I am the shadow of poor Buckingham , Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on By dark'ning my clear sun \u201d ; that is , whose body was even that moment entombed by the darkening of the King 's countenance against him ; he was already a dead man .In like manner , in \u2018 King John , \u2019 ii , i , 500 , the Dauphin of France refers to himself as King , when he says to his father that his shadow , visible in the eye of the Princess , \u201c Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow . \u201d In Richard II , \u2019 iii , 2 , 50 , the King , likening himself to the sun , says that , as the \u201c eye of heaven \u201d reveals the dark deeds of night when he fires the proud tops of the eastern pines , \u201c So when this thief , this traitor , Bolingbroke ... Shall see us rising on our throne , the east , His treasons will sit blushing in his face . \u201d And again , Ibid ., iv , 1 , 260 , transferring the metaphor to Bolingbroke , he wails : \u201c O , that I were a mockery King of snow Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke , To melt myself away in waterdrops . \u201d In \u2018 1 Henry IV , \u2019 iii , 2 , 79 , the King speaks of \u201c sunlike majesty , When it shines seldom in admiring eyes . \u201d In \u2018 Richard III . \u2019 i , 1 , 1 , Gloster says , referring to the King : \u201c Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of York . \u201d In \u2018 Hamlet , \u2019 i , 2 , 67 , the King asks Hamlet : \u201c How is it that the clouds still hang on you ? \u201d and he ironically replies : \u201c Not so , my lord , I am too much i \u2019 the sun . \u201d Here again \u201c sun \u201d means \u201c sunshine , \u201d and Hamlet , choosing to understand the King literally , and referring to the fact that clouds are dissipated by a genial sun , sneeringly protests that he is too much in the sunshine of royalty to have clouds hanging about him . Referring to a different effect of the sun 's warmth , Prince John speaks of \u201c The man that sits within a monarch 's heart And ripens in the sunshine of his favor \u201d ; \u2018 2 Henry IV , \u2019 iv , 2 , 12 . There are other similar uses of the word \u201c sun , \u201d which need not now be cited . The last reference to Ophelia 's supposed relation to the King occurs when Polonius comes to announce the presence of the players :", "If you call me Jephthah , my lord , I have a daughter that", "I have , my lord ."]}, "act_index": 90, "play_index": 10}, {"data": {"540": ["Guthrie 's work indicates in its form some of the characteristics of the new literary art .

It was certain that any new work by the author of Don Juan would be subjected to the severest and most hostile scrutiny , and it was doubtful if a translation of part of an obscure and difficult poem , vaguely supposed to be coarse and irreligious , would meet with even a tolerable measure of success . At any rate , in spite of many inquiries and much vaunting of its excellence, the MS. remained for more than two years in Murray 's hands , and it was not until other arrangements came into force that the translation of the First Canto of the Morgante Maggiore appeared in the fourth and last number of The Liberal , which was issuedJuly 30 , 1823 . For critical estimates of Luigi Pulci and the Morgante Maggiore , see an article, by Ugo Foscolo , entitled \u201c Narrative and Romantic Poems of the Italians ; \u201d Preface to the Orlando Innamorato of Boiardo , by A.

D ., 1898 , pp . 128-131 . ADVERTISEMENT . The Morgante Maggiore , of the first canto of which this translation is offered , divides with the Orlando Innamorato the honour of having formed and suggested the style and story of Ariosto .The great defects of Boiardo were his treating too seriously the narratives of chivalry , and his harsh style . Ariosto , in his continuation , by a judicious mixture of the gaiety of Pulci , has avoided the one ; and Berni , in his reformation of Boiardo 's poem , has corrected the other . Pulci may be considered as the precursor and model of Berni altogether , as he has partly been to Ariosto , however inferior to both his copyists . He is no less the founder of a new style of poetry very lately sprung up in England . I allude to that of the ingenious Whistlecraft . The serious poems on Roncesvalles in the same language , and more particularly the excellent one of Mr. Merivale , are to be traced to the same source .It has never yet been decided entirely whether Pulci 's intention was or was not to deride the religion which is one of his favourite topics . It appears to me , that such an intention would have been no less hazardous to the poet than to the priest , particularly in that age and country ; and the permission to publish the poem , and its reception among the classics of Italy , prove that it neither was nor is so interpreted . That he intended to ridicule the monastic life , and suffered his imagination to play with the simple dulness of his converted giant , seems evident enough ; but surely it were as unjust to accuse him of irreligion on this account , as to denounce Fielding for his Parson Adams , Barnabas ,Thwackum , Supple , and the Ordinary in Jonathan Wild ,\u2014 or Scott , for the exquisite use of his Covenanters in the \u201c Tales of my Landlord . \u201d In the following translation I have used the liberty of the original with the proper names , as Pulci uses Gan , Ganellon , or Ganellone ; Carlo , Carlomagno , or Carlornano ; Rondel , or Rondello , etc ., as it suits his convenience ; so has the translator . In other respects the version is faithful to the best of the translator 's ability in combining his interpretation of the one language with the not very easy task of reducing it to the same versification in the other . The reader , on comparing it with the original , is requested to remember that the antiquated language of Pulci , however pure , is not easy to the generality of Italians themselves , from its great mixture of Tuscan proverbs ; and he may therefore be more indulgent to the present attempt . How far the translator has succeeded , and whether or no he shall continue the work , are questions which the public will decide . He was induced to make the experiment partly by his love for , and partial intercourse with , the Italian language , of which it is so easy to acquire a slight knowledge , and with which it is so nearly impossible for a foreigner to become accurately conversant . The Italian language is like a capricious beauty , who accords her smiles to all , her favours to few , and sometimes least to those who have courted her longest . The translator wished also to present in an English dress a part at least of a poem never yet rendered into a northern language ; at the same time that it has been the original of some of the most celebrated productions on this side of the Alps , as well of those recent experiments in poetry in England which have been already mentioned . THE MORGANTE MAGGIORE .CANTO THE FIRST . I . In the beginning was the Word next God ; God was the Word , the Word no less was He : This was in the beginning , to my mode Of thinking , and without Him nought could be : Therefore , just Lord ! from out thy high abode , Benign and pious , bid an angel flee , One only , to be my companion , who Shall help my famous , worthy , old song through . II . And thou , oh Virgin ! daughter , mother , bride , Of the same Lord , who gave to you each key Of Heaven , and Hell , and every thing beside , The day thy Gabriel said \u201c All hail ! \u201d to thee , Since to thy servants Pity 's ne'er denied , With flowing rhymes , a pleasant style and free , Be to my verses then benignly kind , And to the end illuminate my mind . III . \u2018 Twas in the season when sad PhilomelWeeps with her sister , who remembers and Deplores the ancient woes which both befel , And makes the nymphs enamoured , to the hand Of Pha\u00ebton , by Phoebus loved so well , His carWas given , and on the horizon 's verge just now Appeared , so that Tithonus scratched his brow : IV . When I prepared my bark first to obey , As it should still obey , the helm , my mind , And carry prose or rhyme , and this my lay Of Charles the Emperor , whom you will find By several pens already praised ; but they Who to diffuse his glory were inclined , For all that I can see in prose or verse , Have understood Charles badly , and wrote worse . V . Leonardo Aretino said already ,That if , like Pepin , Charles had had a writer Of genius quick , and diligently steady , No hero would in history look brighter ; He in the cabinet being always ready , And in the field a most victorious fighter , Who for the church and Christian faith had wrought , Certes , far more than yet is said or thought . VI . You still may see at Saint Liberatore ,The abbey , no great way from Manopell , Erected in the Abruzzi to his glory , Because of the great battle in which fell A pagan king , according to the story , And felon people whom Charles sent to Hell : And there are bones so many , and so many , Near them Giusaffa 'swould seem few , if any . VII . But the world , blind and ignorant , do n't prize His virtues as I wish to see them : thou , Florence , by his great bounty do n't arise ,And hast , and may have , if thou wilt allow , All proper customs and true courtesies : Whate'er thou hast acquired from then till now , With knightly courage , treasure , or the lance , Is sprung from out the noble blood of France . VIII . Twelve Paladins had Charles in court , of whom The wisest and most famous was Orlando ; Him traitor Ganconducted to the tomb In Roncesvalles , as the villain planned too , While the horn rang so loud , and knelled the doom Of their sad rout , though he did all knight can do : And Dante in his comedy has given To him a happy seat with Charles in Heaven .IX . \u2018 Twas Christmas-day ; in Paris all his court Charles held ; the Chief , I say , Orlando was , The Dane ; Astolfo there too did resort , Also Ansuigi , the gay time to pass In festival and in triumphal sport , The much-renowned St. Dennis being the cause ; Angiolin of Bayonne , and Oliver , And gentle Belinghieri too came there : X . Avolio , and Arino , and Othone Of Normandy , and Richard Paladin , Wise Hamo , and the ancient Salamone , Walter of Lion 's Mount , and Baldovin , Who was the son of the sad Ganellone , Were there , exciting too much gladness in The son of Pepin :\u2014 when his knights came hither , He groaned with joy to see them altogether . XI . But watchful Fortune , lurking , takes good heed Ever some bar \u2018 gainst our intents to bring . While Charles reposed him thus , in word and deed , Orlando ruled court , Charles , and every thing ; Curst Gan , with envy bursting , had such need To vent his spite , that thus with Charles the king One day he openly began to say , \u201c Orlando must we always then obey ? XII . \u201c A thousand times I 've been about to say , Orlando too presumptuously goes on ; Here are we , counts , kings , dukes , to own thy sway , Hamo , and Otho , Ogier , Solomon , Each have to honour thee and to obey ; But he has too much credit near the throne , Which we wo n't suffer , but are quite decided By such a boy to be no longer guided . XIII . \u201c And even at Aspramont thou didst begin To let him know he was a gallant knight , And by the fount did much the day to win ; But I know who that day had won the fight If it had not for good Gherardo been ; The victory was Almonte 's else ; his sight He kept upon the standard \u2014 and the laurels , In fact and fairness , are his earning , Charles ! XIV . \u201c If thou rememberest being in Gascony , When there advanced the nations out of Spain The Christian cause had suffered shamefully , Had not his valour driven them back again . Best speak the truth when there 's a reason why : Know then , oh Emperor ! that all complain : As for myself , I shall repass the mounts O'er which I crossed with two and sixty counts . XV . \u201c \u2018 Tis fit thy grandeur should dispense relief , So that each here may have his proper part , For the whole court is more or less in grief : Perhaps thou deem'st this lad a Mars in heart ? \u201d Orlando one day heard this speech in brief , As by himself it chanced he sate apart : Displeased he was with Gan because he said it , But much more still that Charles should give him credit . XVI . And with the sword he would have murdered Gan , But Oliver thrust in between the pair , And from his hand extracted Durlindan , And thus at length they separated were . Orlando angry too with Carloman , Wanted but little to have slain him there ; Then forth alone from Paris went the Chief , And burst and maddened with disdain and grief . XVII . From Ermellina , consort of the Dane , He took Cortana , and then took Rondell , And on towards Brara pricked him o'er the plain ; And when she saw him coming , Aldabelle Stretched forth her arms to clasp her lord again : Orlando , in whose brain all was not well , As \u201c Welcome , my Orlando , home , \u201d she said , Raised up his sword to smite her on the head . XVIII . Like him a Fury counsels , his revenge On Gan in that rash act he seemed to take , Which Aldabella thought extremely strange ; But soon Orlando found himself awake ; And his spouse took his bridle on this change , And he dismounted from his horse , and spake Of every thing which passed without demur , And then reposed himself some days with her . XIX . Then full of wrath departed from the place , As far as pagan countries roamed astray , And while he rode , yet still at every pace The traitor Gan remembered by the way ; And wandering on in error a long space , An abbey which in a lone desert lay , \u2018 Midst glens obscure , and distant lands , he found , Which formed the Christian 's and the Pagan 's bound . XX . The Abbot was called Clermont , and by blood Descended from Angrante : under cover Of a great mountain 's brow the abbey stood , But certain savage giants looked him over ; One Passamont was foremost of the brood , And Alabaster and Morgante hover Second and third , with certain slings , and throw In daily jeopardy the place below . XXI . The monks could pass the convent gate no more , Nor leave their cells for water or for wood ; Orlando knocked , but none would ope , before Unto the Prior it at length seemed good ; Entered , he said that he was taught to adore Him who was born of Mary 's holiest blood , And was baptized a Christian ; and then showed How to the abbey he had found his road . XXII . Said the Abbot , \u201c You are welcome ; what is mine We give you freely , since that you believe With us in Mary Mother 's Son divine ; And that you may not , Cavalier , conceive The cause of our delay to let you in To be rusticity , you shall receive The reason why our gate was barred to you : Thus those who in suspicion live must do . XXIII . \u201c When hither to inhabit first we came These mountains , albeit that they are obscure , As you perceive , yet without fear or blame They seemed to promise an asylum sure : From savage brutes alone , too fierce to tame , \u2018 Twas fit our quiet dwelling to secure ; But now , if here we 'd stay , we needs must guard Against domestic beasts with watch and ward . XXIV . \u201c These make us stand , in fact , upon the watch ; For late there have appeared three giants rough , What nation or what kingdom bore the batch I know not , but they are all of savage stuff ; When Force and Malice with some genius match , You know , they can do all \u2014 we are not enough : And these so much our orisons derange , I know not what to do , till matters change . XXV . \u201c Our ancient fathers , living the desert in , For just and holy works were duly fed ; Think not they lived on locusts sole , \u2018 tis certain That manna was rained down from heaven instead ; But here \u2018 tis fit we keep on the alert in Our bounds , or taste the stones showered down for bread , From off yon mountain daily raining faster , And flung by Passamont and Alabaster . XXVI . \u201c The third , Morgante , \u2018 s savagest by far ; he Plucks up pines , beeches , poplar-trees , and oaks , And flings them , our community to bury ; And all that I can do but more provokes . \u201d While thus they parley in the cemetery , A stone from one of their gigantic strokes , Which nearly crushed Rondell , came tumbling over , So that he took a long leap under cover . XXVII . \u201c For God-sake , Cavalier , come in with speed ; The manna 's falling now , \u201d the Abbot cried . \u201c This fellow does not wish my horse should feed , Dear Abbot , \u201d Roland unto him replied , \u201c Of restiveness he 'd cure him had he need ; That stone seems with good will and aim applied . \u201d The holy father said , \u201c I do n't deceive ; They 'll one day fling the mountain , I believe . \u201d XXVIII . Orlando bade them take care of Rondello , And also made a breakfast of his own ; \u201c Abbot , \u201d he said , \u201c I want to find that fellow Who flung at my good horse yon corner-stone . \u201d Said the abbot , \u201c Let not my advice seem shallow ; As to a brother dear I speak alone ; I would dissuade you , Baron , from this strife , As knowing sure that you will lose your life . XXIX . \u201c That Passamont has in his hand three darts \u2014 Such slings , clubs , ballast-stones , that yield you must : You know that giants have much stouter hearts Than us , with reason , in proportion just : If go you will , guard well against their arts , For these are very barbarous and robust . \u201d Orlando answered , \u201d This I 'll see , be sure , And walk the wild on foot to be secure . \u201d XXX . The Abbot signed the great cross on his front , \u201c Then go you with God 's benison and mine . \u201d Orlando , after he had scaled the mount , As the Abbot had directed , kept the line Right to the usual haunt of Passamont ; Who , seeing him alone in this design , Surveyed him fore and aft with eyes observant , Then asked him , \u201c If he wished to stay as servant ? \u201d XXXI . And promised him an office of great ease . But , said Orlando , \u201c Saracen insane ! I come to kill you , if it shall so please God , not to serve as footboy in your train ; You with his monks so oft have broke the peace \u2014 Vile dog ! \u2018 tis past his patience to sustain . \u201d The Giant ran to fetch his arms , quite furious , When he received an answer so injurious . XXXII . And being returned to where Orlando stood , Who had not moved him from the spot , and swinging The cord , he hurled a stone with strength so rude , As showed a sample of his skill in slinging ; It rolled on Count Orlando 's helmet good And head , and set both head and helmet ringing , So that he swooned with pain as if he died , But more than dead , he seemed so stupified . XXXIII . Then Passamont , who thought him slain outright , Said , \u201c I will go , and while he lies along , Disarm me : why such craven did I fight ? \u201d But Christ his servants ne'er abandons long , Especially Orlando , such a knight , As to desert would almost be a wrong . While the giant goes to put off his defences , Orlando has recalled his force and senses : XXXIV . And loud he shouted , \u201c Giant , where dost go ? Thou thought'st me doubtless for the bier outlaid ; To the right about \u2014 without wings thou'rt too slow To fly my vengeance \u2014 currish renegade ! \u2018 Twas but by treachery thou laid'st me low . \u201d The giant his astonishment betrayed , And turned about , and stopped his journey on , And then he stooped to pick up a great stone . XXXV . Orlando had Cortana bare in hand ; To split the head in twain was what he schemed : Cortana clave the skull like a true brand , And pagan Passamont died unredeemed ; Yet harsh and haughty , as he lay he banned , And most devoutly Macon still blasphemed; But while his crude , rude blasphemies he heard , Orlando thanked the Father and the Word ,\u2014 XXXVI . Saying , \u201c What grace to me thou'st this day given ! And I to thee , O Lord ! am ever bound ; I know my life was saved by thee from Heaven , Since by the Giant I was fairly downed . All things by thee are measured just and even ; Our power without thine aid would nought be found : I pray thee take heed of me , till I can At least return once more to Carloman . \u201d XXXVII . And having said thus much , he went his way ; And Alabaster he found out below , Doing the very best that in him lay To root from out a bank a rock or two . Orlando , when he reached him , loud \u2018 gan say , \u201c How think'st thou , glutton , such a stone to throw ? \u201d When Alabaster heard his deep voice ring , He suddenly betook him to his sling , XXXVIII . And hurled a fragment of a size so large That if it had in fact fulfilled its mission , And Roland not availed him of his targe , There would have been no need of a physicianOrlando set himself in turn to charge , And in his bulky bosom made incision With all his sword . The lout fell ; but o'erthrown , he However by no means forgot Macone . XXXIX . Morgante had a palace in his mode , Composed of branches , logs of wood , and earth , And stretched himself at ease in this abode , And shut himself at night within his berth . Orlando knocked , and knocked again , to goad The giant from his sleep ; and he came forth , The door to open , like a crazy thing , For a rough dream had shook him slumbering . XL . He thought that a fierce serpent had attacked him , And Mahomet he called ; but Mahomet Is nothing worth , and , not an instant backed him ; But praying blessed Jesu , he was set At liberty from all the fears which racked him ; And to the gate he came with great regret \u2014 \u201c Who knocks here ? \u201d grumbling all the while , said he . \u201c That , \u201d said Orlando , \u201c you will quickly see : XLI . \u201c I come to preach to you , as to your brothers ,\u2014 Sent by the miserable monks \u2014 repentance ; For Providence divine , in you and others , Condemns the evil done , my new acquaintance ! \u2018 Tis writ on high \u2014 your wrong must pay another 's : From Heaven itself is issued out this sentence . Know then , that colder now than a pilaster I left your Passamont and Alabaster . \u201d XLII . Morgante said , \u201c Oh gentle Cavalier ! Now by thy God say me no villany ; The favour of your name I fain would hear , And if a Christian , speak for courtesy . \u201d Replied Orlando , \u201c So much to your ear I by my faith disclose contentedly ; Christ I adore , who is the genuine Lord , And , if you please , by you may be adored . \u201d XLIII . The Saracen rejoined in humble tone , \u201c I have had an extraordinary vision ; A savage serpent fell on me alone , And Macon would not pity my condition ; Hence to thy God , who for ye did atone Upon the cross , preferred I my petition ; His timely succour set me safe and free , And I a Christian am disposed to be . \u201d XLIV . Orlando answered , \u201c Baron just and pious , If this good wish your heart can really move To the true God , who will not then deny us Eternal honour , you will go above , And , if you please , as friends we will ally us , And I will love you with a perfect love . Your idols are vain liars , full of fraud : The only true God is the Christian 's God . XLV . \u201c The Lord descended to the virgin breast Of Mary Mother , sinless and divine ; If you acknowledge the Redeemer blest , Without whom neither sun nor star can shine , Abjure bad Macon 's false and felon test , Your renegado god , and worship mine , Baptize yourself with zeal , since you repent . \u201d To which Morgante answered , \u201c I 'm content . \u201d XLVI . And then Orlando to embrace him flew , And made much of his convert , as he cried , \u201c To the abbey I will gladly marshal you . \u201d To whom Morgante , \u201c Let us go , \u201d replied : \u201c I to the friars have for peace to sue . \u201d Which thing Orlando heard with inward pride , Saying , \u201c My brother , so devout and good , Ask the Abbot pardon , as I wish you would : XLVII . \u201c Since God has granted your illumination , Accepting you in mercy for his own , Humility should be your first oblation . \u201d Morgante said , \u201c For goodness \u2019 sake , make known ,\u2014 Since that your God is to be mine \u2014 your station , And let your name in verity be shown ; Then will I everything at your command do . \u201d On which the other said , he was Orlando . XLVIII . \u201c Then , \u201d quoth the Giant , \u201c blessed be Jesu A thousand times with gratitude and praise ! Oft , perfect Baron ! have I heard of you Through all the different periods of my days : And , as I said , to be your vassal too I wish , for your great gallantry always . \u201d Thus reasoning , they continued much to say , And onwards to the abbey went their way . XLIX . And by the way about the giants dead Orlando with Morgante reasoned : \u201c Be , For their decease , I pray you , comforted , And , since it is God 's pleasure , pardon me ; A thousand wrongs unto the monks they bred ; And our true Scripture soundeth openly , Good is rewarded , and chastised the ill , Which the Lord never faileth to fulfil : L . \u201c Because His love of justice unto all Is such , He wills His judgment should devour All who have sin , however great or small ; But good He well remembers to restore . Nor without justice holy could we call Him , whom I now require you to adore . All men must make His will their wishes sway , And quickly and spontaneously obey . LI . \u201c And here our doctors are of one accord , Coming on this point to the same conclusion ,\u2014 That in their thoughts , who praise in Heaven the Lord , If Pity e'er was guilty of intrusion For their unfortunate relations stored In Hell below , and damned in great confusion , Their happiness would be reduced to nought ,\u2014 And thus unjust the Almighty 's self be thought . LII . \u201c But they in Christ have firmest hope , and all Which seems to Him , to them too must appear Well done ; nor could it otherwise befall ; He never can in any purpose err . If sire or mother suffer endless thrall , They do n't disturb themselves for him or her : What pleases God to them must joy inspire ;\u2014 Such is the observance of the eternal choir . \u201d LIII . \u201c A word unto the wise , \u201d Morgante said , \u201c Is wont to be enough , and you shall see How much I grieve about my brethren dead ; And if the will of God seem good to me , Just , as you tell me , \u2018 tis in Heaven obeyed \u2014 Ashes to ashes ,\u2014 merry let us be ! I will cut off the hands from both their trunks , And carry them unto the holy monks . LIV . \u201c So that all persons may be sure and certain That they are dead , and have no further fear To wander solitary this desert in , And that they may perceive my spirit clear By the Lord 's grace , who hath withdrawn the curtain Of darkness , making His bright realm appear . \u201d He cut his brethren 's hands off at these words , And left them to the savage beasts and birds . LV . Then to the abbey they went on together , Where waited them the Abbot in great doubt . The monks , who knew not yet the fact , ran thither To their superior , all in breathless rout , Saying with tremor , \u201c Please to tell us whether You wish to have this person in or out ? \u201d The Abbot , looking through upon the Giant , Too greatly feared , at first , to be compliant . LVI . Orlando seeing him thus agitated , Said quickly , \u201c Abbot , be thou of good cheer ; He Christ believes , as Christian must be rated , And hath renounced his Macon false ; \u201d which here Morgante with the hands corroborated , A proof of both the giants \u2019 fate quite clear : Thence , with due thanks , the Abbot God adored , Saying , \u201c Thou hast contented me , O Lord ! \u201d LVII . He gazed ; Morgante 's height he calculated , And more than once contemplated his size ; And then he said , \u201c O Giant celebrated ! Know , that no more my wonder will arise , How you could tear and fling the trees you late did , When I behold your form with my own eyes . You now a true and perfect friend will show Yourself to Christ , as once you were a foe . LVIII . \u201c And one of our apostles , Saul once named , Long persecuted sore the faith of Christ , Till , one day , by the Spirit being inflamed , \u2018 Why dost thou persecute me thus ? \u2019 said Christ ; And then from his offence he was reclaimed , And went for ever after preaching Christ , And of the faith became a trump , whose sounding O'er the whole earth is echoing and rebounding . LIX . \u201c So , my Morgante , you may do likewise : He who repents \u2014 thus writes the Evangelist \u2014 Occasions more rejoicing in the skies Than ninety-nine of the celestial list . You may be sure , should each desire arise With just zeal for the Lord , that you 'll exist Among the happy saints for evermore ; But you were lost and damned to Hell before ! \u201d LX . And thus great honour to Morgante paid The Abbot : many days they did repose . One day , as with Orlando they both strayed , And sauntered here and there , where'er they chose , The Abbot showed a chamber , where arrayed Much armour was , and hung up certain bows ; And one of these Morgante for a whim Girt on , though useless , he believed , to him . LXI . There being a want of water in the place , Orlando , like a worthy brother , said , \u201c Morgante , I could wish you in this case To go for water . \u201d \u201c You shall be obeyed In all commands , \u201d was the reply , \u201c straight ways . \u201d Upon his shoulder a great tub he laid , And went out on his way unto a fountain , Where he was wont to drink , below the mountain . LXII . Arrived there , a prodigious noise he hears , Which suddenly along the forest spread ; Whereat from out his quiver he prepares An arrow for his bow , and lifts his head ; And lo ! a monstrous herd of swine appears , And onward rushes with tempestuous tread , And to the fountain 's brink precisely pours ; So that the Giant 's joined by all the boars . LXIII . Morgante at a venture shot an arrow , Which pierced a pig precisely in the ear , And passed unto the other side quite through ; So that the boar , defunct , lay tripped up near . Another , to revenge his fellow farrow , Against the Giant rushed in fierce career , And reached the passage with so swift a foot , Morgante was not now in time to shoot . LXIV . Perceiving that the pig was on him close , He gave him such a punch upon the head, As floored him so that he no more arose , Smashing the very bone ; and he fell dead Next to the other . Having seen such blows , The other pigs along the valley fled ; Morgante on his neck the bucket took , Full from the spring , which neither swerved nor shook . LXV . The tub was on one shoulder , and there were The hogs on t'other , and he brushed apace On to the abbey , though by no means near , Nor spilt one drop of water in his race . Orlando , seeing him so soon appear With the dead boars , and with that brimful vase , Marvelled to see his strength so very great ; So did the Abbot , and set wide the gate . LXVI . The monks , who saw the water fresh and good, Rejoiced , but much more to perceive the pork ; All animals are glad at sight of food : They lay their breviaries to sleep , and work With greedy pleasure , and in such a mood , That the flesh needs no salt beneath their fork . Of rankness and of rot there is no fear , For all the fasts are now left in arrear . LXVII . As though they wished to burst at once , they ate ; And gorged so that , as if the bones had been In water , sorely grieved the dog and cat , Perceiving that they all were picked too clean . The Abbot , who to all did honour great , A few days after this convivial scene , Gave to Morgante a fine horse , well trained , Which he long time had for himself maintained . LXVIII . The horse Morgante to a meadow led , To gallop , and to put him to the proof , Thinking that he a back of iron had , Or to skim eggs unbroke was light enough ; But the horse , sinking with the pain , fell dead , And burst , while cold on earth lay head and hoof . Morgante said , \u201c Get up , thou sulky cur ! \u201d And still continued pricking with the spur . LXIX . But finally he thought fit to dismount , And said , \u201c I am as light as any feather , And he has burst ;\u2014 to this what say you , Count ? \u201d Orlando answered , \u201c Like a ship 's mast rather You seem to me , and with the truck for front : Let him go ! Fortune wills that we together Should march , but you on foot Morgante still . \u201d To which the Giant answered , \u201d So I will . LXX . \u201c When there shall be occasion , you will see How I approve my courage in the fight . \u201d Orlando said , \u201c I really think you 'll be , If it should prove God 's will , a goodly knight ; Nor will you napping there discover me . But never mind your horse , though out of sight \u2018 Twere best to carry him into some wood , If but the means or way I understood . \u201d LXXI . The Giant said , \u201c Then carry him I will , Since that to carry me he was so slack \u2014 To render , as the gods do , good for ill ; But lend a hand to place him on my back . \u201d Orlando answered , \u201c If my counsel still May weigh , Morgante , do not undertake To lift or carry this dead courser , who , As you have done to him , will do to you . LXXII . \u201c Take care he do n't revenge himself , though dead , As Nessus did of old beyond all cure . I do n't know if the fact you 've heard or read ; But he will make you burst , you may be sure . \u201d \u201c But help him on my back , \u201d Morgante said , \u201c And you shall see what weight I can endure . In place , my gentle Roland , of this palfrey , With all the bells , I 'd carry yonder belfry . \u201d LXXIII . The Abbot said , \u201c The steeple may do well , But for the bells , you 've broken them , I wot . \u201d Morgante answered , \u201c Let them pay in Hell The penalty who lie dead in yon grot ; \u201d And hoisting up the horse from where he fell , He said , \u201c Now look if I the gout have got , Orlando , in the legs ,\u2014 or if I have force ; \u201d \u2014 And then he made two gambols with the horse . LXXIV . Morgante was like any mountain framed ; So if he did this \u2018 tis no prodigy ; But secretly himself Orlando blamed , Because he was one of his family ; And fearing that he might be hurt or maimed , Once more he bade him lay his burden by : \u201c Put down , nor bear him further the desert in . \u201d Morgante said , \u201c I 'll carry him for certain . \u201d LXXV . He did ; and stowed him in some nook away , And to the abbey then returned with speed . Orlando said , \u201c Why longer do we stay ? Morgante , here is nought to do indeed . \u201d The Abbot by the hand he took one day , And said , with great respect , he had agreed To leave his reverence ; but for this decision He wished to have his pardon and permission . LXXVI . The honours they continued to receive Perhaps exceeded what his merits claimed : He said , \u201c I mean , and quickly , to retrieve The lost days of time past , which may be blamed ; Some days ago I should have asked your leave , Kind father , but I really was ashamed , And know not how to show my sentiment , So much I see you with our stay content . LXXVII . \u201c But in my heart I bear through every clime The Abbot , abbey , and this solitude \u2014 So much I love you in so short a time ; For me , from Heaven reward you with all good The God so true , the eternal Lord sublime ! Whose kingdom at the last hath open stood . Meantime we stand expectant of your blessing . And recommend us to your prayers with pressing . \u201d LXXVIII . Now when the Abbot Count Orlando heard , His heart grew soft with inner tenderness , Such fervour in his bosom bred each word ; And , \u201c Cavalier , \u201d he said , \u201c if I have less Courteous and kind to your great worth appeared , Than fits me for such gentle blood to express , I know I have done too little in this case ; But blame our ignorance , and this poor place . LXXIX . \u201c We can indeed but honour you with masses , And sermons , thanksgivings , and pater-nosters , Hot suppers , dinners; But such a love for you my heart embraces , For thousand virtues which your bosom fosters , That wheresoe'er you go I too shall be , And , on the other part , you rest with me . LXXX . \u201c This may involve a seeming contradiction ; But you I know are sage , and feel , and taste , And understand my speech with full conviction . For your just pious deeds may you be graced With the Lord 's great reward and benediction , By whom you were directed to this waste : To His high mercy is our freedom due , For which we render thanks to Him and you . LXXXI . \u201c You saved at once our life and soul : such fear The Giants caused us , that the way was lost By which we could pursue a fit career In search of Jesus and the saintly Host ; And your departure breeds such sorrow here , That comfortless we all are to our cost ; But months and years you would not stay in sloth , Nor are you formed to wear our sober cloth , LXXXII . \u201c But to bear arms , and wield the lance ; indeed , With these as much is done as with this cowl ; In proof of which the Scripture you may read , This Giant up to Heaven may bear his soul By your compassion : now in peace proceed . Your state and name I seek not to unroll ; But , if I 'm asked , this answer shall be given , That here an angel was sent down from Heaven . LXXXIII . \u201c If you want armour or aught else , go in , Look o'er the wardrobe , and take what you choose , And cover with it o'er this Giant 's skin . \u201d Orlando answered , \u201c If there should lie loose Some armour , ere our journey we begin , Which might be turned to my companion 's use , The gift would be acceptable to me . \u201d The Abbot said to him , \u201c Come in and see . \u201d LXXXIV . And in a certain closet , where the wall Was covered with old armour like a crust , The Abbot said to them , \u201c I give you all . \u201d Morgante rummaged piecemeal from the dust The whole , which , save one cuirass, was too small , And that too had the mail inlaid with rust . They wondered how it fitted him exactly , Which ne'er had suited others so compactly . LXXXV . \u2018 Twas an immeasurable Giant 's , who By the great Milo of Agrante fell Before the abbey many years ago . The story on the wall was figured well ; In the last moment of the abbey 's foe , Who long had waged a war implacable : Precisely as the war occurred they drew him , And there was Milo as he overthrew him . LXXXVI . Seeing this history , Count Orlando said In his own heart , \u201c O God who in the sky Know'st all things ! how was Milo hither led ? Who caused the Giant in this place to die ? \u201d And certain letters , weeping , then he read , So that he could not keep his visage dry ,\u2014 As I will tell in the ensuing story : From evil keep you the high King of Glory !\u201c Com \u2019 egli ebbe un Ormanno e \u2018 l suo Turpino . \u201d The allusion to \u201c Ormanno , \u201d who has been identified with a mythical chronicler , \u201c Urmano from Paris \u201d, and the appeal to the authority of Leonardo Aretino , must not be taken au pied de la lettre . At the same time , the opinion attributed to Leonardo is in accordance with contemporary sentiment and phraseology .

DEDICATION . Lady ! if for the cold and cloudy clime Where I was born , but where I would not die , Of the great Poet-Sire of Italy I dare to buildthe imitative rhyme , Harsh Runiccopy of the South 's sublime , Thou art the cause ; and howsoever I Fall short of his immortal harmony , Thy gentle heart will pardon me the crime . Thou , in the pride of Beauty and of Youth , Spakest ; and for thee to speak and be obeyed Are one ; but only in the sunny South Such sounds are uttered , and such charms displayed , So sweet a language from so fair a mouth \u2014Ah ! to what effort would it not persuade ? Ravenna , June 21 , 1819 . PREFACE In the course of a visit to the city of Ravenna in the summer of 1819 , it was suggested to the author that having composed something on the subject of Tasso 's confinement , he should do the same on Dante 's exile ,\u2014 the tomb of the poet forming one of the principal objectsof interest in that city , both to the native and to the stranger . \u201c On this hint I spake , \u201d and the result has been the following four cantos , in terza rima , now offered to the reader . If they are understood and approved , it is my purpose to continue the poem in various other cantos to its natural conclusion in the present age . The reader is requested to suppose that Dante addresses him in the interval between the conclusion of the Divina Commedia and his death , and shortly before the latter event , foretelling the fortunes of Italy in general in the ensuing centuries . In adopting this plan I have had in my mind the Cassandra of Lycophron ,and the Prophecy of Nereus by Horace , as well as the Prophecies of Holy Writ . The measure adopted is the terza rima of Dante , which I am not aware to have seen hitherto tried in our language , except it may be by Mr. Hayley ,of whose translation I never saw but one extract , quoted in the notes to Caliph Vathek ; so that \u2014 if I do not err \u2014 this poem may be considered as a metrical experiment . The cantos are short , and about the same length of those of the poet , whose name I have borrowed and most likely taken in vain . Amongst the inconveniences of authors in the present day , it is difficult for any who have a name , good or bad , to escape translation . I have had the fortune to see the fourth canto of Childe Haroldtranslated into Italian versi sciolti ,\u2014 that is , a poem written in the Spenserean stanza into blank verse , without regard to the natural divisions of the stanza or the sense . If the present poem , being on a national topic , should chance to undergo the same fate , I would request the Italian reader to remember that when I have failed in the imitation of his great \u201c Padre Alighier , \u201dI have failed in imitating that which all study and few understand , since to this very day it is not yet settled what was the meaning of the allegoryin the first canto of the Inferno , unless Count Marchetti 's ingenious and probable conjecture may be considered as having decided the question . He may also pardon my failure the more , as I am not quite sure that he would be pleased with my success , since the Italians , with a pardonable nationality , are particularly jealous of all that is left them as a nation \u2014 their literature ; and in the present bitterness of the classic and romantic war , are but ill disposed to permit a foreigner even to approve or imitate them , without finding some fault with his ultramontane presumption . I can easily enter into all this , knowing what would be thought in England of an Italian imitator of Milton , or if a translation of Monti , Pindemonte , or Arici ,should be held up to the rising generation as a model for their future poetical essays . But I perceive that I am deviating into an address to the Italian reader , where my business is with the English one ; and be they few or many , I must take my leave of both . THE PROPHECY OF DANTE . CANTO THE FIRST . Once more in Man 's frail world ! which I had left So long that \u2018 twas forgotten ; and I feel The weight of clay again ,\u2014 too soon bereft Of the Immortal Vision which could heal My earthly sorrows , and to God 's own skies Lift me from that deep Gulf without repeal , Where late my ears rung with the damned cries Of Souls in hopeless bale ; and from that place Of lesser torment , whence men may arise Pure from the fire to join the Angelic race ; 10 Midst whom my own bright Beatric\u0113blessed My spirit with her light ; and to the base Of the Eternal Triad ! first , last , best ,Mysterious , three , sole , infinite , great God ! Soul universal ! led the mortal guest , Unblasted by the Glory , though he trod From star to star to reach the almighty throne .Oh Beatrice ! whose sweet limbs the sod So long hath pressed , and the cold marble stone , Thou sole pure Seraph of my earliest love , 20 Love so ineffable , and so alone , That nought on earth could more my bosom move , And meeting thee in Heaven was but to meet That without which my Soul , like the arkless dove , Had wandered still in search of , nor her feet Relieved her wing till found ; without thy light My Paradise had still been incomplete .Since my tenth sun gave summer to my sight Thou wert my Life , the Essence of my thought , Loved ere I knew the name of Love ,and bright 30 Still in these dim old eyes , now overwrought With the World 's war , and years , and banishment , And tears for thee , by other woes untaught ; For mine is not a nature to be bent By tyrannous faction , and the brawling crowd , And though the long , long conflict hath been spent In vain ,\u2014 and never more , save when the cloud Which overhangs the Apennine my mind 's eye Pierces to fancy Florence , once so proud Of me , can I return , though but to die , 40 Unto my native soil ,\u2014 they have not yet Quenched the old exile 's spirit , stern and high . But the Sun , though not overcast , must set And the night cometh ; I am old in days , And deeds , and contemplation , and have met Destruction face to face in all his ways . The World hath left me , what it found me , pure , And if I have not gathered yet its praise , I sought it not by any baser lure ; Man wrongs , and Time avenges , and my name 50 May form a monument not all obscure , Though such was not my Ambition 's end or aim , To add to the vain-glorious list of those Who dabble in the pettiness of fame , And make men 's fickle breath the wind that blows Their sail , and deem it glory to be classed With conquerors , and Virtue 's other foes , In bloody chronicles of ages past . I would have had my Florence great and free ;Oh Florence ! Florence !unto me thou wast 60 Like that Jerusalem which the Almighty He Wept over , \u201c but thou wouldst not ; \u201d as the bird Gathers its young , I would have gathered thee Beneath a parent pinion , hadst thou heard My voice ; but as the adder , deaf and fierce , Against the breast that cherished thee was stirred Thy venom , and my state thou didst amerce , And doom this body forfeit to the fire .Alas ! how bitter is his country 's curse To him who for that country would expire , 70 But did not merit to expire by her , And loves her , loves her even in her ire . The day may come when she will cease to err , The day may come she would be proud to have The dust she dooms to scatter , and transferOf him , whom she denied a home , the grave . But this shall not be granted ; let my dust Lie where it falls ; nor shall the soil which gave Me breath , but in her sudden fury thrust Me forth to breathe elsewhere , so reassume 80 My indignant bones , because her angry gust Forsooth is over , and repealed her doom ; No ,\u2014 she denied me what was mine \u2014 my roof , And shall not have what is not hers \u2014 my tomb . Too long her arm\u00e9d wrath hath kept aloof The breast which would have bled for her , the heart That beat , the mind that was temptation proof , The man who fought , toiled , travelled , and each part Of a true citizen fulfilled , and saw For his reward the Guelf 's ascendant art 90 Pass his destruction even into a law . These things are not made for forgetfulness , Florence shall be forgotten first ; too raw The wound , too deep the wrong , and the distress Of such endurance too prolonged to make My pardon greater , her injustice less , Though late repented ; yet \u2014 yet for her sake I feel some fonder yearnings , and for thine , My own Beatric\u0113 , I would hardly take Vengeance upon the land which once was mine , 100 And still is hallowed by thy dust 's return , Which would protect the murderess like a shrine , And save ten thousand foes by thy sole urn . Though , like old Marius from Minturn\u00e6 's marsh And Carthage ruins , my lone breast may burn At times with evil feelings hot and harsh ,And sometimes the last pangs of a vile foe Writhe in a dream before me , and o'erarch My brow with hopes of triumph ,\u2014 let them go ! Such are the last infirmities of those 110 Who long have suffered more than mortal woe , And yet being mortal still , have no repose But on the pillow of Revenge \u2014 Revenge , Who sleeps to dream of blood , and waking glows With the oft-baffled , slakeless thirst of change , When we shall mount again , and they that trod Be trampled on , while Death and At\u00e9 range O'er humbled heads and severed necks \u2014\u2014 Great God ! Take these thoughts from me \u2014 to thy hands I yield My many wrongs , and thine Almighty rod 120 Will fall on those who smote me ,\u2014 be my Shield ! As thou hast been in peril , and in pain , In turbulent cities , and the tented field \u2014 In toil , and many troubles borne in vain For Florence ,\u2014 I appeal from her to Thee ! Thee , whom I late saw in thy loftiest reign , Even in that glorious Vision , which to see And live was never granted until now , And yet thou hast permitted this to me . Alas ! with what a weight upon my brow 130 The sense of earth and earthly things come back , Corrosive passions , feelings dull and low , The heart 's quick throb upon the mental rack , Long day , and dreary night ; the retrospect Of half a century bloody and black , And the frail few years I may yet expect Hoary and hopeless , but less hard to bear , For I have been too long and deeply wrecked On the lone rock of desolate Despair , To lift my eyes more to the passing sail 140 Which shuns that reef so horrible and bare ; Nor raise my voice \u2014 for who would heed my wail ? I am not of this people , nor this age , And yet my harpings will unfold a tale Which shall preserve these times when not a page Of their perturb\u00e9d annals could attract An eye to gaze upon their civil rage ,Did not my verse embalm full many an act Worthless as they who wrought it : \u2018 tis the doom Of spirits of my order to be racked 150 In life , to wear their hearts out , and consume Their days in endless strife , and die alone ; Then future thousands crowd around their tomb , And pilgrims come from climes where they have known The name of him \u2014 who now is but a name , And wasting homage o'er the sullen stone , Spread his \u2014 by him unheard , unheeded \u2014 fame ; And mine at least hath cost me dear : to die Is nothing ; but to wither thus \u2014 to tame My mind down from its own infinity \u2014 160 To live in narrow ways with little men , A common sight to every common eye , A wanderer , while even wolves can find a den , Ripped from all kindred , from all home , all things That make communion sweet , and soften pain \u2014 To feel me in the solitude of kings Without the power that makes them bear a crown \u2014 To envy every dove his nest and wings Which waft him where the Apennine looks down On Arno , till he perches , it may be , 170 Within my all inexorable town , Where yet my boys are , and that fatal She ,Their mother , the cold partner who hath brought Destruction for a dowry \u2014 this to see And feel , and know without repair , hath taught A bitter lesson ; but it leaves me free : I have not vilely found , nor basely sought , They made an Exile \u2014 not a Slave of me . CANTO THE SECOND . The Spirit of the fervent days of Old , When words were things that came to pass , and Thought Flashed o'er the future , bidding men behold Their children 's children 's doom already brought Forth from the abyss of Time which is to be , The Chaos of events , where lie half-wrought Shapes that must undergo mortality ; What the great Seers of Israel wore within , That Spirit was on them , and is on me , And if , Cassandra-like , amidst the din 10 Of conflict none will hear , or hearing heed This voice from out the Wilderness , the sin Be theirs , and my own feelings be my meed , The only guerdon I have ever known . Hast thou not bled ? and hast thou still to bleed , Italia ? Ah ! to me such things , foreshown With dim sepulchral light , bid me forget In thine irreparable wrongs my own ; We can have but one Country , and even yet Thou'rt mine \u2014 my bones shall be within thy breast , 20 My Soul within thy language , which once set With our old Roman sway in the wide West ; But I will make another tongue arise As lofty and more sweet , in which expressed The hero 's ardour , or the lover 's sighs , Shall find alike such sounds for every theme That every word , as brilliant as thy skies , Shall realise a Poet 's proudest dream , And make thee Europe 's Nightingale of Song ;So that all present speech to thine shall seem 30 The note of meaner birds , and every tongue Confess its barbarism when compared with thine .This shalt thou owe to him thou didst so wrong , Thy Tuscan bard , the banished Ghibelline . Woe ! woe ! the veil of coming centuries Is rent ,\u2014 a thousand years which yet supine Lie like the ocean waves ere winds arise , Heaving in dark and sullen undulation , Float from Eternity into these eyes ; The storms yet sleep , the clouds still keep their station , 40 The unborn Earthquake yet is in the womb , The bloody Chaos yet expects Creation , But all things are disposing for thy doom ; The Elements await but for the Word , \u201c Let there be darkness ! \u201d and thou grow'st a tomb ! Yes ! thou , so beautiful , shalt feel the sword ,Thou , Italy ! so fair that Paradise , Revived in thee , blooms forth to man restored : Ah ! must the sons of Adam lose it twice ? Thou , Italy ! whose ever golden fields , 50 Ploughed by the sunbeams solely , would suffice For the world 's granary ; thou , whose sky Heaven gildsWith brighter stars , and robes with deeper blue ; Thou , in whose pleasant places Summer builds Her palace , in whose cradle Empire grew , And formed the Eternal City 's ornaments From spoils of Kings whom freemen overthrew ; Birthplace of heroes , sanctuary of Saints , Where earthly first , then heavenly glory madeHer home ; thou , all which fondest Fancy paints , 60 And finds her prior vision but portrayed In feeble colours , when the eye \u2014 from the Alp Of horrid snow , and rock , and shaggy shade Of desert-loving pine , whose emerald scalp Nods to the storm \u2014 dilates and dotes o'er thee , And wistfully implores , as \u2018 twere , for help To see thy sunny fields , my Italy , Nearer and nearer yet , and dearer still The more approached , and dearest were they free , Thou \u2014 Thou must wither to each tyrant 's will : 70 The Goth hath been ,\u2014 the German , Frank , and HunAre yet to come ,\u2014 and on the imperial hill Ruin , already proud of the deeds done By the old barbarians , there awaits the new , Throned on the Palatine , while lost and won Rome at her feet lies bleeding ; and the hue Of human sacrifice and Roman slaughter Troubles the clotted air , of late so blue , And deepens into red the saffron water Of Tiber , thick with dead ; the helpless priest , 80 And still more helpless nor less holy daughter , Vowed to their God , have shrieking fled , and ceased Their ministry : the nations take their prey , Iberian , Almain , Lombard , and the beast And bird , wolf , vulture , more humane than they Are ; these but gorge the flesh , and lap the gore Of the departed , and then go their way ; But those , the human savages , explore All paths of torture , and insatiate yet , With Ugolino hunger prowl for more . 90 Nine moons shall rise o'er scenes like this and set ;The chiefless army of the dead , which late Beneath the traitor Prince 's banner met , Hath left its leader 's ashes at the gate ; Had but the royal Rebel lived , perchance Thou hadst been spared , but his involved thy fate . Oh ! Rome , the Spoiler or the spoil of France , From Brennus to the Bourbon , never , never Shall foreign standard to thy walls advance , But Tiber shall become a mournful river . 100 Oh ! when the strangers pass the Alps and Po , Crush them , ye Rocks ! Floods whelm them , and for ever ! Why sleep the idle Avalanches so , To topple on the lonely pilgrim 's head ? Why doth Eridanus but overflow The peasant 's harvest from his turbid bed ? Were not each barbarous horde a nobler prey ? Over Cambyses \u2019 hostthe desert spread Her sandy ocean , and the Sea-waves \u2019 sway Rolled over Pharaoh and his thousands ,\u2014 why ,110 Mountains and waters , do ye not as they ? And you , ye Men ! Romans , who dare not die , Sons of the conquerors who overthrew Those who overthrew proud Xerxes , where yet lie The dead whose tomb Oblivion never knew , Are the Alps weaker than Thermopyl\u00e6 ? Their passes more alluring to the view Of an invader ? is it they , or ye , That to each host the mountain-gate unbar , And leave the march in peace , the passage free ? 120 Why , Nature 's self detains the Victor 's car , And makes your land impregnable , if earth Could be so ; but alone she will not war , Yet aids the warrior worthy of his birth In a soil where the mothers bring forth men : Not so with those whose souls are little worth ; For them no fortress can avail ,\u2014 the den Of the poor reptile which preserves its sting Is more secure than walls of adamant , when The hearts of those within are quivering . 130 Are ye not brave ? Yes , yet the Ausonian soil Hath hearts , and hands , and arms , and hosts to bring Against Oppression ; but how vain the toil , While still Division sows the seeds of woe And weakness , till the Stranger reaps the spoil .Oh ! my own beauteous land ! so long laid low , So long the grave of thy own children 's hopes , When there is but required a single blow To break the chain , yet \u2014 yet the Avenger stops , And Doubt and Discord step \u2018 twixt thine and thee , 140 And join their strength to that which with thee copes ; What is there wanting then to set thee free , And show thy beauty in its fullest light ? To make the Alps impassable ; and we , Her Sons , may do this with one deed \u2014 Unite . CANTO THE THIRD . From out the mass of never-dying ill ,The Plague , the Prince , the Stranger , and the Sword , Vials of wrath but emptied to refill And flow again , I cannot all record That crowds on my prophetic eye : the Earth And Ocean written o'er would not afford Space for the annal , yet it shall go forth ; Yes , all , though not by human pen , is graven , There where the farthest suns and stars have birth , Spread like a banner at the gate of Heaven , 10 The bloody scroll of our millennial wrongs Waves , and the echo of our groans is driven Athwart the sound of archangelic songs , And Italy , the martyred nation 's gore , Will not in vain arise to where belongsOmnipotence and Mercy evermore : Like to a harpstring stricken by the wind , The sound of her lament shall , rising o'er The Seraph voices , touch the Almighty Mind . Meantime I , humblest of thy sons , and of 20 Earth 's dust by immortality refined To Sense and Suffering , though the vain may scoff , And tyrants threat , and meeker victims bow Before the storm because its breath is rough , To thee , my Country ! whom before , as now , I loved and love , devote the mournful lyre And melancholy gift high Powers allow To read the future : and if now my fire Is not as once it shone o'er thee , forgive ! I but foretell thy fortunes \u2014 then expire ; 30 Think not that I would look on them and live . A Spirit forces me to see and speak , And for my guerdon grants not to survive ; My Heart shall be poured over thee and break : Yet for a moment , ere I must resume Thy sable web of Sorrow , let me take Over the gleams that flash athwart thy gloom A softer glimpse ; some stars shine through thy night , And many meteors , and above thy tomb Leans sculptured Beauty , which Death cannot blight : 40 And from thine ashes boundless Spirits rise To give thee honour , and the earth delight ; Thy soil shall still be pregnant with the wise , The gay , the learned , the generous , and the brave , Native to thee as Summer to thy skies , Conquerors on foreign shores , and the far wave ,Discoverers of new worlds , which take their name ;For thee alone they have no arm to save , And all thy recompense is in their fame , A noble one to them , but not to thee \u2014 50 Shall they be glorious , and thou still the same ? Oh ! more than these illustrious far shall be The Being \u2014 and even yet he may be born \u2014 The mortal Saviour who shall set thee free , And see thy diadem , so changed and worn By fresh barbarians , on thy brow replaced ; And the sweet Sun replenishing thy morn , Thy moral morn , too long with clouds defaced , And noxious vapours from Avernus risen , Such as all they must breathe who are debased 60 By Servitude , and have the mind in prison .Yet through this centuried eclipse of woeSome voices shall be heard , and Earth shall listen ; Poets shall follow in the path I show , And make it broader : the same brilliant sky Which cheers the birds to song shall bid them glow ,And raise their notes as natural and high ; Tuneful shall be their numbers ; they shall sing Many of Love , and some of Liberty , But few shall soar upon that Eagle 's wing , 70 And look in the Sun 's face , with Eagle 's gaze , All free and fearless as the feathered King , But fly more near the earth ; how many a phrase Sublime shall lavished be on some small prince In all the prodigality of Praise ! And language , eloquently false , evinceThe harlotry of Genius , which , like Beauty ,Too oft forgets its own self-reverence , And looks on prostitution as a duty .He who once enters in a Tyrant 's hall80 As guest is slave \u2014 his thoughts become a booty , And the first day which sees the chain enthral A captive , sees his half of Manhood gone\u2014 The Soul 's emasculation saddens all His spirit ; thus the Bard too near the throne Quails from his inspiration , bound to please ,\u2014 How servile is the task to please alone ! To smooth the verse to suit his Sovereign 's ease And royal leisure , nor too much prolong Aught save his eulogy , and find , and seize , 90 Or force , or forge fit argument of Song ! Thus trammelled , thus condemned to Flattery 's trebles , He toils through all , still trembling to be wrong : For fear some noble thoughts , like heavenly rebels , Should rise up in high treason to his brain , He sings , as the Athenian spoke , with pebbles In 's mouth , lest Truth should stammer through his strain . But out of the long file of sonneteers There shall be some who will not sing in vain , And he , their Prince , shall rank among my peers ,And Love shall be his torment ; but his grief Shall make an immortality of tears , And Italy shall hail him as the Chief Of Poet-lovers , and his higher song Of Freedom wreathe him with as green a leaf . But in a farther age shall rise along The banks of Po two greater still than he ; The World which smiled on him shall do them wrong Till they are ashes , and repose with me . The first will make an epoch with his lyre , 110 And fill the earth with feats of Chivalry :His Fancy like a rainbow , and his Fire , Like that of Heaven , immortal , and his Thought Borne onward with a wing that cannot tire ; Pleasure shall , like a butterfly new caught , Flutter her lovely pinions o'er his theme , And Art itself seem into Nature wrought By the transparency of his bright dream .\u2014 The second , of a tenderer , sadder mood , Shall pour his soul out o'er Jerusalem ; 120 He , too , shall sing of Arms , and Christian blood Shed where Christ bled for man ; and his high harp Shall , by the willow over Jordan 's flood , Revive a song of Sion , and the sharp Conflict , and final triumph of the brave And pious , and the strife of Hell to warp Their hearts from their great purpose , until wave The red-cross banners where the first red Cross Was crimsoned from His veins who died to save ,Shall be his sacred argument ; the loss 130 Of years , of favour , freedom , even of fame Contested for a time , while the smooth gloss Of Courts would slide o'er his forgotten name And call Captivity a kindness \u2014 meant To shield him from insanity or shame \u2014 Such shall be his meek guerdon ! who was sent To be Christ 's Laureate \u2014 they reward him well ! Florence dooms me but death or banishment , Ferrara him a pittance and a cell ,Harder to bear and less deserved , for I 140 Had stung the factions which I strove to quell ; But this meek man who with a lover 's eye Will look on Earth and Heaven , and who will deign To embalm with his celestial flattery , As poor a thing as e'er was spawned to reign ,What will he do to merit such a doom ? Perhaps he 'll love ,\u2014 and is not Love in vain Torture enough without a living tomb ? Yet it will be so \u2014 he and his compeer , The Bard of Chivalry , will both consume150 In penury and pain too many a year , And , dying in despondency , bequeath To the kind World , which scarce will yield a tear , A heritage enriching all who breathe With the wealth of a genuine Poet 's soul , And to their country a redoubled wreath , Unmatched by time ; not Hellas can unroll Through her Olympiads two such names , though oneOf hers be mighty ;\u2014 and is this the whole Of such men 's destiny beneath the Sun ?160 Must all the finer thoughts , the thrilling sense , The electric blood with which their arteries run ,Their body 's self turned soul with the intense Feeling of that which is , and fancy of That which should be , to such a recompense Conduct ? shall their bright plumage on the rough Storm be still scattered ? Yes , and it must be ; For , formed of far too penetrable stuff , These birds of Paradisebut long to flee Back to their native mansion , soon they find 170 Earth 's mist with their pure pinions not agree , And die or are degraded ; for the mind Succumbs to long infection , and despair , And vulture Passions flying close behind , Await the moment to assail and tear ;And when , at length , the wing\u00e9d wanderers stoop , Then is the Prey-birds \u2019 triumph , then they share The spoil , o'erpowered at length by one fell swoop . Yet some have been untouched who learned to bear , Some whom no Power could ever force to droop , 180 Who could resist themselves even , hardest care ! And task most hopeless ; but some such have been , And if my name amongst the number were , That Destiny austere , and yet serene , Were prouder than more dazzling fame unblessed ; The Alp 's snow summit nearer heaven is seen Than the Volcano 's fierce eruptive crest , Whose splendour from the black abyss is flung , While the scorched mountain , from whose burning breast A temporary torturing flame is wrung , 190 Shines for a night of terror , then repels Its fire back to the Hell from whence it sprung , The Hell which in its entrails ever dwells . CANTO THE FOURTH . Many are Poets who have never penned Their inspiration , and perchance the best : They felt , and loved , and died , but would not lend Their thoughts to meaner beings ; they compressed The God within them , and rejoined the stars Unlaurelled upon earth , but far more blessed Than those who are degraded by the jars Of Passion , and their frailties linked to fame , Conquerors of high renown , but full of scars . Many are Poets but without the name ; 10 For what is Poesy but to create From overfeeling Good or Ill ; and aimAt an external life beyond our fate , And be the new Prometheus of new men ,Bestowing fire from Heaven , and then , too late , Finding the pleasure given repaid with pain , And vultures to the heart of the bestower , Who , having lavished his high gift in vain , Lies to his lone rock by the sea-shore ? So be it : we can bear .\u2014 But thus all they 20 Whose Intellect is an o'ermastering Power Which still recoils from its encumbering clay Or lightens it to spirit , whatsoe'er The form which their creations may essay , Are bards ; the kindled Marble 's bust may wear More poesy upon its speaking brow Than aught less than the Homeric page may bear ; One noble stroke with a whole life may glow , Or deify the canvass till it shine With beauty so surpassing all below , 30 That they who kneel to Idols so divine Break no commandment , for high Heaven is there Transfused , transfigurated :and the line Of Poesy , which peoples but the air With Thought and Beings of our thought reflected , Can do no more : then let the artist share The palm , he shares the peril , and dejected Faints o'er the labour unapproved \u2014 Alas ! Despair and Genius are too oft connected . Within the ages which before me pass 40 Art shall resume and equal even the sway Which with Apelles and old Phidias She held in Hellas \u2019 unforgotten day . Ye shall be taught by Ruin to revive The Grecian forms at least from their decay , And Roman souls at last again shall live In Roman works wrought by Italian hands , And temples , loftier than the old temples , give New wonders to the World ; and while still stands The austere Pantheon , into heaven shall soar 50 A Dome ,its image , while the base expands Into a fane surpassing all before , Such as all flesh shall flock to kneel in : ne'er Such sight hath been unfolded by a door As this , to which all nations shall repair , And lay their sins at this huge gate of Heaven . And the bold Architectunto whose care The daring charge to raise it shall be given , Whom all Arts shall acknowledge as their Lord , Whether into the marble chaos driven 60 His chisel bid the Hebrew ,at whose word Israel left Egypt , stop the waves in stone ,Or hues of Hell be by his pencil poured Over the damned before the Judgement-throne ,Such as I saw them , such as all shall see , Or fanes be built of grandeur yet unknown \u2014 The Stream of his great thoughts shall spring from meThe Ghibelline , who traversed the three realms Which form the Empire of Eternity . Amidst the clash of swords , and clang of helms , 70 The age which I anticipate , no less Shall be the Age of Beauty , and while whelms Calamity the nations with distress , The Genius of my Country shall arise , A Cedar towering o'er the Wilderness , Lovely in all its branches to all eyes , Fragrant as fair , and recognised afar , Wafting its native incense through the skies . Sovereigns shall pause amidst their sport of war , Weaned for an hour from blood , to turn and gaze 80 On canvass or on stone ; and they who mar All beauty upon earth , compelled to praise , Shall feel the power of that which they destroy ; And Art 's mistaken gratitude shall raise To tyrants , who but take her for a toy , Emblems and monuments , and prostitute Her charms to Pontiffs proud ,who but employ The man of Genius as the meanest brute To bear a burthen , and to serve a need , To sell his labours , and his soul to boot . 90 Who toils for nations may be poor indeed , But free ; who sweats for Monarchs is no more Than the gilt Chamberlain , who , clothed and feed , Stands sleek and slavish , bowing at his door . Oh , Power that rulest and inspirest ! how Is it that they on earth , whose earthly powerIs likest thine in heaven in outward show , Least like to thee in attributes divine , Tread on the universal necks that bow , And then assure us that their rights are thine ? 100 And how is it that they , the Sons of Fame , Whose inspiration seems to them to shine From high , they whom the nations oftest name , Must pass their days in penury or pain , Or step to grandeur through the paths of shame , And wear a deeper brand and gaudier chain ? Or if their Destiny be born aloof From lowliness , or tempted thence in vain , In their own souls sustain a harder proof , The inner war of Passions deep and fierce ? 110 Florence ! when thy harsh sentence razed my roof , I loved thee ; but the vengeance of my verse , The hate of injuries which every year Makes greater , and accumulates my curse , Shall live , outliving all thou holdest dear \u2014 Thy pride , thy wealth , thy freedom , and even that , The most infernal of all evils here , The sway of petty tyrants in a state ; For such sway is not limited to Kings , And Demagogues yield to them but in date , 120 As swept off sooner ; in all deadly things , Which make men hate themselves , and one another , In discord , cowardice , cruelty , all that springs From Death the Sin-born 's incest with his mother ,In rank oppression in its rudest shape , The faction Chief is but the Sultan 's brother , And the worst Despot 's far less human ape . Florence ! when this lone spirit , which so long Yearned , as the captive toiling at escape , To fly back to thee in despite of wrong , 130 An exile , saddest of all prisoners ,Who has the whole world for a dungeon strong , Seas , mountains , and the horizon 'sverge for bars ,Which shut him from the sole small spot of earth Where \u2014 whatsoe'er his fate \u2014 he still were hers , His Country 's , and might die where he had birth \u2014 Florence ! when this lone Spirit shall return To kindred Spirits , thou wilt feel my worth , And seek to honour with an empty urnThe ashes thou shalt ne'er obtain \u2014 Alas ! 140 \u201c What have I done to thee , my People ? \u201dStern Are all thy dealings , but in this they pass The limits of Man 's common malice , for All that a citizen could be I was \u2014 Raised by thy will , all thine in peace or war \u2014 And for this thou hast warred with me .\u2014 \u2018 Tis done : I may not overleap the eternal barBuilt up between us , and will die alone , Beholding with the dark eye of a Seer The evil days to gifted souls foreshown , 150 Foretelling them to those who will not hear ; As in the old time , till the hour be come When Truth shall strike their eyes through many a tear , And make them own the Prophet in his tomb .

But Lionardo Aretino is scandalised with Boccace , in his life of Dante , for saying that literary men should not marry . \u201c Qui il Boccaccio non ha pazienza , e dice , le mogli esser contrarie agli studj ; e non si ricorda che Socrate , il pi\u00f9 nobile filosofo che mai fusse , ebbe moglie e figliuoli e ufici nella Repubblica nella sua Citt\u00e0 ; e Aristotile che , etc ., etc ., ebbe due moglie in varj tempi , ed ebbe figliuoli , e ricchezze assai .\u2014 E Marco Tullio \u2014 e Catone \u2014 e Varrone \u2014 e Seneca \u2014 ebbero moglie , \u201d etc ., etc .It is odd that honest Lionardo 's examples , with the exception of Seneca , and , for anything I know , of Aristotle , are not the most felicitous . Tully 's Terentia , and Socrates \u2019 Xantippe , by no means contributed to their husbands \u2019 happiness , whatever they might do to their philosophy \u2014 Cato gave away his wife \u2014 of Varro 's we know nothing \u2014 and of Seneca 's , only that she was disposed to die with him , but recovered and lived several years afterwards .

There is , however , not the slightest reason for believing that the words which he put into the mouth of Jacopo Rusticucci , \u201c La fiera moglie pi\u00f9 ch'altro , mi nuoce \u201d, were winged with any personal reminiscence or animosity .

I tried what I could to get De Montford revived , but in vain , and equally in vain in favour of Sotheby 's Ivan , which was thought an acting play ; and I endeavoured also to wake Mr. Coleridge to write us a tragedyThose who are not in the secret will hardly believe that the School for Scandal is the play which has brought the least money , averaging the number of times it has been acted since its production ; so Manager Dibdin assured me . Of what has occurred since Maturin 's Bertram I am not aware; so that I may be traducing , through ignorance , some excellent new writers ; if so , I beg their pardon . I have been absent from England nearly five years , and , till last year , I never read an English newspaper since my departure , and am now only aware of theatrical matters through the medium of the Parisian Gazette of Galignani , and only for the last twelve months . Let me , then , deprecate all offence to tragic or comic writers , to whom I wish well , and of whom I know nothing . The long complaints of the actual state of the drama arise , however , from no fault of the performers . I can conceive nothing better than Kemble , Cooke , and Kean , in their very different manners , or than Elliston in Gentleman 's comedy , and in some parts of tragedy . Miss O'NeillI never saw , having made and kept a determination to see nothing which should divide or disturb my recollection of Siddons . Siddons and Kemble were the ideal of tragic action ; I never saw anything at all resembling them , even in person ; for this reason , we shall never see again Coriolanus or Macbeth . When Kean is blamed for want of dignity , we should remember that it is a grace , not an art , and not to be attained by study . In all , not super-natural parts , he is perfect ; even his very defects belong , or seem to belong , to the parts themselves , and appear truer to nature . But of Kemble we may say , with reference to his acting , what the Cardinal de Retz said of the Marquis of Montrose , \u201c that he was the only man he ever saw who reminded him of the heroes of Plutarch . \u201d, and passages from Byron 's Detached Thoughtsibid ., pp . 230 , 233-238 . ], Letters , 1899 , iii . 233 , and letter to Murray , October 12 , 1817 , Letters , 1900 , iv . 171 . )], afterwards Lady Becher , made her d\u00e9but in 1814 , and retired from the stage in 1819 . Sarah Siddonsmade her final appearance on the stage June 9 , 1818 , and her brother John Philip Kembleappeared for the last time in Coriolanus , June 23 , 1817 . Of the other actors mentioned in this note , George Frederick Cookehad long been dead ; Edmund Keanhad just returned from a successful tour in the United States ; and Robert William Ellistonhad , not long before, become lessee of Drury Lane Theatre . ]{ 339 }He would , too , be deeply and genuinely moved by such verse as this \u2014 \u201c Consult a holy man ! inquire of him ! \u2014 Good father , wherefore ? what should I inquire ?

He had been despatched by the X. to Legnano , to investigate the conduct of Andrea Donate , the Doge 's brother-in-law , who was suspected of having embezzled the public moneys . His report was unfavourable to Donato , and , shortly after , he too fell sick and died .

INTRODUCTION TO CAIN . Cain was begun at Ravenna , July 16 , and finished September 9 , 1821Six months before , when he was at work on the first act of Sardanapalus , Byron had \u201c pondered \u201d Cain , but it was not till Sardanapalus and a second historical play , The Two Foscari , had been written , copied out , and sent to England , that he indulged his genius with a third drama \u2014 on \u201c a metaphysical subject , something in the style of Manfred \u201dGoethe 's comment on reading and reviewing Cain was that he should be surprised if Byron did not pursue the treatment of such \u201c biblical subjects , \u201d as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah; and , many years after , he told Crabb Robinsonthat Byron should have lived \u201c to execute his vocation ... to dramatize the Old Testament . \u201d He was better equipped for such a task than might have been imagined . A Scottish schoolboy , \u201c from a child he had known the Scriptures , \u201d and , as his Hebrew Melodies testify , he was not unwilling to turn to the Bible as a source of poetic inspiration . Moreover , he was born with the religious temperament . Questions \u201c of Providence , foreknowledge , will and fate , \u201d exercised his curiosity because they appealed to his imagination and moved his spirit . He was eager to plunge into controversy with friends and advisers who challenged or rebuked him , Hodgson , for instance , or Dallas ; and he responded with remarkable amenity to the strictures and exhortations of such orthodox professors as Mr. Sheppard and Dr. Kennedy . He was , no doubt , from first to last a heretic , impatient , not to say contemptuous , of authority , but he was by no means indifferent to religion altogether . To \u201c argue about it and about \u201d was a necessity , if not an agreeable relief , to his intellectual energies . It would appear from the Ravenna diary, that the conception of Lucifer was working in his brain before the \u201c tragedy of Cain \u201d was actually begun . He had been recording a \u201c thought \u201d which had come to him , that \u201c at the very height of human desire and pleasure , a certain sense of doubt and sorrow \u201d \u2014 an amari aliquid which links the future to the past , and so blots out the present \u2014 \u201c mingles with our bliss , \u201d making it of none effect , and , by way of moral or corollary to his soliloquy , he adds three lines of verse headed , \u201c Thought for a speech of Lucifer in the Tragedy of Cain \u201d \u2014 \u201c Were Death an Evil , would I let thee live ? Fool ! live as I live \u2014 as thy father lives , And thy son 's sons shall live for evermore . \u201d In these three lines , which were not inserted in the play , and in the preceding \u201c thought , \u201d we have the key-note to Cain . \u201c Man walketh in a vain shadow \u201d \u2014 a shadow which he can never overtake , the shadow of an eternally postponed fruition . With a being capable of infinite satisfaction , he is doomed to realize failure in attainment . In all that is best and most enjoyable , \u201c the rapturous moment and the placid hour , \u201d there is a foretaste of \u201c Death the Unknown \u201d ! The tragedy of Manfred lies in remorse for the inevitable past ; the tragedy of Cain , in revolt against the limitations of the inexorable present . The investigation of the \u201c sources \u201d of Cain does not lead to any very definite conclusionHe was pleased to call his play \u201c a Mystery , \u201d and , in his Preface, Byron alludes to the Old Mysteries as \u201c those very profane productions , whether in English , French , Italian , or Spanish . \u201d The first reprint of the Chester Plays was published by the Roxburghe Club in 1818 , but Byron 's knowledge of Mystery Plays was probably derived from Dodsley 's Plays, or from John Stevens 's Continuation of Dugdale 's Monasticon, or possibly , as Herr Schaffner suggests , from Warton 's History of English Poetry , ed . 1871 , ii . 222-230 . He may , too , have witnessed some belated Rappresentazione of the Creation and Fall at Ravenna , or in one of the remoter towns or villages of Italy . There is a superficial resemblance between the treatment of the actual encounter of Cain and Abel , and the conventional rendering of the same incident in the Ludus Coventri\u00e6 , and in the Mist\u00e8re du Viel Testament ; but it is unlikely that he had closely studied any one Mystery Play at first hand . On the other hand , his recollections of Gessner 's Death of Abel which \u201c he had never read since he was eight years old , \u201d were clearer than he imagined . Not only in such minor matters as the destruction of Cain 's altar by a whirlwind , and the substitution of the Angel of the Lord for the Deus of the Mysteries , but in the Teutonic domesticities of Cain and Adah , and the evangelical piety of Adam and Abel , there is a reflection , if not an imitation , of the German idyllOf his indebtedness to Milton he makes no formal acknowledgment , but he was not ashamed to shelter himself behind Milton 's shield when he was attacked on the score of blasphemy and profanity . \u201c If Cain be blasphemous , Paradise Lost is blasphemous \u201d, was , he would fain believe , a conclusive answer to his accusers . But apart from verbal parallels or coincidences , there is a genuine affinity between Byron 's Lucifer and Milton 's Satan . Lucifer , like Satan , is \u201c not less than Archangel ruined , \u201d a repulsed but \u201c unvanquished Titan , \u201d marred by a demonic sorrow , a confessor though a rival of Omnipotence . He is a majestic and , as a rule , a serious and solemn spirit , who compels the admiration and possibly the sympathy of the reader . There is , however , another strain in his ghostly attributes , which betrays a more recent consanguinity : now and again he gives token that he is of the lineage of Mephistopheles . He is sometimes , though rarely , a mocking as well as a rebellious spirit , and occasionally indulges in a grim persiflage beneath the dignity if not the capacity of Satan . It is needless to add that Lucifer has a most lifelike personality of his own . The conception of the spirit of evil justifying an eternal antagonism to the Creator from the standpoint of a superior morality , may , perhaps , be traced to a Manichean source , but it has been touched with a new emotion . Milton 's devil is an abstraction of infernal pride \u2014 \u201c Sole Positive of Night ! Antipathist of Light ! Fate 's only essence ! primal scorpion rod \u2014 The one permitted opposite of God ! \u201d Goethe 's devil is an abstraction of scorn . He \u201c maketh a mock \u201d alike of good and evil ! But Byron 's devil is a spirit , yet a mortal too \u2014 the traducer , because he has suffered for his sins ; the deceiver , because he is self-deceived ; the hoper against hope that there is a ransom for the soul in perfect self-will and not in perfect self-sacrifice . Byron did not uphold Lucifer , but he \u201c had passed that way , \u201d and could imagine a spiritual warfare not only against the Deus of the Mysteries or of the Book of Genesis , but against what he believed and acknowledged to be the Author and Principle of good . Autres temps , autres m\u0153urs ! It is all but impossible for the modern reader to appreciate the audacity of Cain , or to realize the alarm and indignation which it aroused by its appearance . Byron knew that he was raising a tempest , and pleads , in his Preface , \u201c that with regard to the language of Lucifer , it was difficult for me to make him talk like a clergyman , \u201d and again and again he assures his correspondentsthat it is Lucifer and not Byron who puts such awkward questions with regard to the \u201c politics of paradise \u201d and the origin of evil . Nobody seems to have believed him . It was taken for granted that Lucifer was the mouthpiece of Byron , that the author of Don Juan was not \u201c on the side of the angels . \u201d Little need be said of the \u201c literature , \u201d the pamphlets and poems which were evoked by the publication of Cain : A Mystery . One of the most prominent assailants, Archdeacon of Cleveland , 1832 , author inter alia of Original Sin , Free Will , etc ., 1818 ) issued A Remonstrance to Mr. John Murray , respecting a Recent Publication , 1822 , signed \u201c Oxoniensis . \u201d The sting of the Remonstrance lay in the exposure of the fact that Byron was indebted to Bayle 's Dictionary for his rabbinical legends , and that he had derived from the same source his Manichean doctrines of the Two Principles , etc ., and other \u201c often-refuted sophisms \u201d with regard to the origin of evil . Byron does not borrow more than a poet and a gentleman is at liberty to acquire by way of raw material , but it cannot be denied that he had read and inwardly digested more than one of Bayle 's \u201c most objectionable articles \u201dThe Remonstrance was answered in A Letter to Sir Walter Scott , etc ., by \u201c Harroviensis . \u201d Byron welcomed such a \u201c Defender of the Faith , \u201d and was anxious that Murray should print the letter together with the poem . But Murray belittled the \u201c defender , \u201d and was upbraided in turn for his slowness of heartFresh combatants rushed into the fray : \u201c Philo-Milton , \u201d with a Vindication of the \u201c Paradise Lost \u201d from the charge of exculpating \u201c Cain : A Mystery , \u201d London , 1822 ; \u201c Britannicus , \u201d with a pamphlet entitled , Revolutionary Causes , etc ., and A Postscript containing Strictures on \u201c Cain , \u201d etc ., London , 1822 , etc . ; but their works , which hardly deserve to be catalogued , have perished with them . Finally , in 1830 , a barrister named Harding Grant , author of Chancery Practice , compiled a workof more than four hundred pages , in which he treats \u201c the proceedings and speeches of Lucifer with the same earnestness as if they were existing and earthly personages . \u201d But it was \u201c a week too late . \u201d The \u201c Coryph\u00e6us of the Satanic School \u201d had passed away , and the tumult had \u201c dwindled to a calm . \u201d Cain \u201c appeared in conjunction with \u201d Sardanapalus and The Two Foscari , December 19 , 1821 . Last but not least of the three plays , it had been announced \u201c by a separate advertisement, for the purpose of exciting the greater curiosity \u201d, 1822 , p. 383 ) , and it was no sooner published than it was pirated . In the following January , \u201c Cain : A Mystery , by the author of Don Juan , \u201d was issued by W. Benbow , at Castle Street , Leicester SquareMurray had paid Byron \u00a3 2710 for the three tragedies , and in order to protect the copyright , he applied , through counsel, for an injunction in Chancery to stop the sale of piratical editions of Cain . In delivering judgment, the Chancellor , Lord Eldon, replying to Shadwell , drew a comparison between Cain and Paradise Lost , \u201c which he had read from beginning to end during the course of the last Long Vacation \u2014 solicit\u00e6 jucunda oblivia vit\u00e6 . \u201d No one , he argued , could deny that the object and effects of Paradise Lost were \u201c not to bring into disrepute , \u201d but \u201c to promote reverence for our religion , \u201d and , per contra , no one could affirm that it was impossible to arrive at an opposite conclusion with regard to \u201c the Preface , the poem , the general tone and manner of Cain . \u201d It was a question for a jury . A jury might decide that Cain was blasphemous , and void of copyright ; and as there was a reasonable doubt in his mind as to the character of the book , and a doubt as to the conclusion at which a jury would arrive , he was compelled to refuse the injunction . According to Dr . Smiles, the decision of a jury was taken , and an injunction eventually granted . If so , it was ineffectual , for Benbow issued another edition of Cain in 1824See , too , the case of Murray v. Benbow and Another , as reported in the Examiner , February 17 , 1822 ; and cases of Wolcot v. Walker , Southey v. Sherwood , Murray v. Benbow , and Lawrence v. Smith\u201c Cain , \u201d said Moore, \u201c has made a sensation . \u201d Friends and champions , the press , the public \u201c turned up their thumbs . \u201d Gifford shook his head ; Hobhouse \u201c launched out into a most violent invective \u201d; Jeffrey , in the Edinburgh , was regretful and hortatory ; Heber , in the Quarterly , was fault-finding and contemptuous . The \u201c parsons preached at it from Kentish Town to Pisa \u201dEven \u201c the very highest authority in the land , \u201d his Majesty King George IV ., \u201c expressed his disapprobation of the blasphemy and licentiousness of Lord Byron 's writings \u201dByron himself was forced to admit that \u201c my Mont Saint Jean seems Cain \u201dThe many were unanimous in their verdict , but the higher court of the few reversed the judgment . Goethe said that \u201c Its beauty is such as we shall not see a second time in the world \u201d; Scott , in speaking of \u201c the very grand and tremendous drama of Cain , \u201d said that the author had \u201c matched Milton on his own ground \u201d; \u201c Cain , \u201d wrote Shelley to Gisborne, \u201c is apocalyptic ; it is a revelation never before communicated to man . \u201d Uncritical praise , as well as uncritical censure , belongs to the past ; but the play remains , a singular exercise of \u201c poetic energy , \u201d a confession , ex animo , of \u201c the burthen of the mystery , ... the heavy and the weary weight Of all this unintelligible world . \u201d For reviews of Cain : A Mystery , vide ante , \u201c Introduction to Sardanapalus , \u201d p. 5 ; see , too , Eclectic Review , May , 1822 , N.

TO SIR WALTER SCOTT , BART ., THIS MYSTERY OF CAIN IS INSCRIBED , BY HIS OBLIGED FRIEND AND FAITHFUL SERVANT , THE AUTHOR .PREFACE The following scenes are entitled \u201c A Mystery , \u201d in conformity with the ancient title annexed to dramas upon similar subjects , which were styled \u201c Mysteries , or Moralities . \u201dThe author has by no means taken the same liberties with his subject which were common formerly , as may be seen by any reader curious enough to refer to those very profane productions , whether in English , French , Italian , or Spanish . The author has endeavoured to preserve the language adapted to his characters ; and where it istaken from actual Scripture , he has made as little alteration , even of words , as the rhythm would permit . The reader will recollect that the book of Genesis does not state that Eve was tempted by a demon , but by \u201c the Serpent; \u201d and that only because he was \u201c the most subtil of all the beasts of the field . \u201d Whatever interpretation the Rabbins and the Fathers may have put upon this , I take the words as I find them , and reply , with Bishop Watsonupon similar occasions , when the Fathers were quoted to him as Moderator in the schools of Cambridge , \u201c Behold the Book ! \u201d \u2014 holding up the Scripture . It is to be recollected , that my present subject has nothing to do with the New Testament , to which no reference can be here made without anachronism .With the poems upon similar topics I have not been recently familiar . Since I was twenty I have never read Milton ; but I had read him so frequently before , that this may make little difference . Gesner 's \u201c Death of Abel \u201d I have never read since I was eight years of age , at Aberdeen . The general impression of my recollection is delight ; but of the contents I remember only that Cain 's wife was called Mahala , and Abel 's Thirza ; in the following pages I have called them \u201c Adah \u201d and \u201c Zillah , \u201d the earliest female names which occur in Genesis . They were those of Lamech 's wives : those of Cain and Abel are not called by their names . Whether , then , a coincidence of subject may have caused the same in expression , I know nothing , and care as little .am prepared to be accused of Manicheism ,or some other hard name ending in ism , which makes a formidable figure and awful sound in the eyes and ears of those who would be as much puzzled to explain the terms so bandied about , as the liberal and pious indulgers in such epithets . Against such I can defend myself , or , if necessary , I can attack in turn . \u201c Claw for claw , as Conan said to Satan and the deevil take the shortest nails \u201d] The reader will please to bear in mind, that there is no allusion to a future state in any of the books of Moses , nor indeed in the Old Testament . For a reason for this extraordinary omission he may consult Warburton 's \u201c Divine Legation ; \u201dwhether satisfactory or not , no better has yet been assigned . I have therefore supposed it new to Cain , without , I hope , any perversion of Holy Writ . With regard to the language of Lucifer , it was difficult for me to make him talk like a clergyman upon the same subjects ; but I have done what I could to restrain him within the bounds of spiritual politeness .

INTRODUCTION TO CAIN . Cain was begun at Ravenna , July 16 , and finished September 9 , 1821Six months before , when he was at work on the first act of Sardanapalus , Byron had \u201c pondered \u201d Cain , but it was not till Sardanapalus and a second historical play , The Two Foscari , had been written , copied out , and sent to England , that he indulged his genius with a third drama \u2014 on \u201c a metaphysical subject , something in the style of Manfred \u201dGoethe 's comment on reading and reviewing Cain was that he should be surprised if Byron did not pursue the treatment of such \u201c biblical subjects , \u201d as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah; and , many years after , he told Crabb Robinsonthat Byron should have lived \u201c to execute his vocation ... to dramatize the Old Testament . \u201d He was better equipped for such a task than might have been imagined . A Scottish schoolboy , \u201c from a child he had known the Scriptures , \u201d and , as his Hebrew Melodies testify , he was not unwilling to turn to the Bible as a source of poetic inspiration . Moreover , he was born with the religious temperament . Questions \u201c of Providence , foreknowledge , will and fate , \u201d exercised his curiosity because they appealed to his imagination and moved his spirit . He was eager to plunge into controversy with friends and advisers who challenged or rebuked him , Hodgson , for instance , or Dallas ; and he responded with remarkable amenity to the strictures and exhortations of such orthodox professors as Mr. Sheppard and Dr. Kennedy . He was , no doubt , from first to last a heretic , impatient , not to say contemptuous , of authority , but he was by no means indifferent to religion altogether . To \u201c argue about it and about \u201d was a necessity , if not an agreeable relief , to his intellectual energies . It would appear from the Ravenna diary, that the conception of Lucifer was working in his brain before the \u201c tragedy of Cain \u201d was actually begun . He had been recording a \u201c thought \u201d which had come to him , that \u201c at the very height of human desire and pleasure , a certain sense of doubt and sorrow \u201d \u2014 an amari aliquid which links the future to the past , and so blots out the present \u2014 \u201c mingles with our bliss , \u201d making it of none effect , and , by way of moral or corollary to his soliloquy , he adds three lines of verse headed , \u201c Thought for a speech of Lucifer in the Tragedy of Cain \u201d \u2014 \u201c Were Death an Evil , would I let thee live ? Fool ! live as I live \u2014 as thy father lives , And thy son 's sons shall live for evermore . \u201d In these three lines , which were not inserted in the play , and in the preceding \u201c thought , \u201d we have the key-note to Cain . \u201c Man walketh in a vain shadow \u201d \u2014 a shadow which he can never overtake , the shadow of an eternally postponed fruition . With a being capable of infinite satisfaction , he is doomed to realize failure in attainment . In all that is best and most enjoyable , \u201c the rapturous moment and the placid hour , \u201d there is a foretaste of \u201c Death the Unknown \u201d ! The tragedy of Manfred lies in remorse for the inevitable past ; the tragedy of Cain , in revolt against the limitations of the inexorable present . The investigation of the \u201c sources \u201d of Cain does not lead to any very definite conclusionHe was pleased to call his play \u201c a Mystery , \u201d and , in his Preface, Byron alludes to the Old Mysteries as \u201c those very profane productions , whether in English , French , Italian , or Spanish . \u201d The first reprint of the Chester Plays was published by the Roxburghe Club in 1818 , but Byron 's knowledge of Mystery Plays was probably derived from Dodsley 's Plays, or from John Stevens 's Continuation of Dugdale 's Monasticon, or possibly , as Herr Schaffner suggests , from Warton 's History of English Poetry , ed . 1871 , ii . 222-230 . He may , too , have witnessed some belated Rappresentazione of the Creation and Fall at Ravenna , or in one of the remoter towns or villages of Italy . There is a superficial resemblance between the treatment of the actual encounter of Cain and Abel , and the conventional rendering of the same incident in the Ludus Coventri\u00e6 , and in the Mist\u00e8re du Viel Testament ; but it is unlikely that he had closely studied any one Mystery Play at first hand . On the other hand , his recollections of Gessner 's Death of Abel which \u201c he had never read since he was eight years old , \u201d were clearer than he imagined . Not only in such minor matters as the destruction of Cain 's altar by a whirlwind , and the substitution of the Angel of the Lord for the Deus of the Mysteries , but in the Teutonic domesticities of Cain and Adah , and the evangelical piety of Adam and Abel , there is a reflection , if not an imitation , of the German idyllOf his indebtedness to Milton he makes no formal acknowledgment , but he was not ashamed to shelter himself behind Milton 's shield when he was attacked on the score of blasphemy and profanity . \u201c If Cain be blasphemous , Paradise Lost is blasphemous \u201d, was , he would fain believe , a conclusive answer to his accusers . But apart from verbal parallels or coincidences , there is a genuine affinity between Byron 's Lucifer and Milton 's Satan . Lucifer , like Satan , is \u201c not less than Archangel ruined , \u201d a repulsed but \u201c unvanquished Titan , \u201d marred by a demonic sorrow , a confessor though a rival of Omnipotence . He is a majestic and , as a rule , a serious and solemn spirit , who compels the admiration and possibly the sympathy of the reader . There is , however , another strain in his ghostly attributes , which betrays a more recent consanguinity : now and again he gives token that he is of the lineage of Mephistopheles . He is sometimes , though rarely , a mocking as well as a rebellious spirit , and occasionally indulges in a grim persiflage beneath the dignity if not the capacity of Satan . It is needless to add that Lucifer has a most lifelike personality of his own . The conception of the spirit of evil justifying an eternal antagonism to the Creator from the standpoint of a superior morality , may , perhaps , be traced to a Manichean source , but it has been touched with a new emotion . Milton 's devil is an abstraction of infernal pride \u2014 \u201c Sole Positive of Night ! Antipathist of Light ! Fate 's only essence ! primal scorpion rod \u2014 The one permitted opposite of God ! \u201d Goethe 's devil is an abstraction of scorn . He \u201c maketh a mock \u201d alike of good and evil ! But Byron 's devil is a spirit , yet a mortal too \u2014 the traducer , because he has suffered for his sins ; the deceiver , because he is self-deceived ; the hoper against hope that there is a ransom for the soul in perfect self-will and not in perfect self-sacrifice . Byron did not uphold Lucifer , but he \u201c had passed that way , \u201d and could imagine a spiritual warfare not only against the Deus of the Mysteries or of the Book of Genesis , but against what he believed and acknowledged to be the Author and Principle of good . Autres temps , autres m\u0153urs ! It is all but impossible for the modern reader to appreciate the audacity of Cain , or to realize the alarm and indignation which it aroused by its appearance . Byron knew that he was raising a tempest , and pleads , in his Preface , \u201c that with regard to the language of Lucifer , it was difficult for me to make him talk like a clergyman , \u201d and again and again he assures his correspondentsthat it is Lucifer and not Byron who puts such awkward questions with regard to the \u201c politics of paradise \u201d and the origin of evil . Nobody seems to have believed him . It was taken for granted that Lucifer was the mouthpiece of Byron , that the author of Don Juan was not \u201c on the side of the angels . \u201d Little need be said of the \u201c literature , \u201d the pamphlets and poems which were evoked by the publication of Cain : A Mystery . One of the most prominent assailants, Archdeacon of Cleveland , 1832 , author inter alia of Original Sin , Free Will , etc ., 1818 ) issued A Remonstrance to Mr. John Murray , respecting a Recent Publication , 1822 , signed \u201c Oxoniensis . \u201d The sting of the Remonstrance lay in the exposure of the fact that Byron was indebted to Bayle 's Dictionary for his rabbinical legends , and that he had derived from the same source his Manichean doctrines of the Two Principles , etc ., and other \u201c often-refuted sophisms \u201d with regard to the origin of evil . Byron does not borrow more than a poet and a gentleman is at liberty to acquire by way of raw material , but it cannot be denied that he had read and inwardly digested more than one of Bayle 's \u201c most objectionable articles \u201dThe Remonstrance was answered in A Letter to Sir Walter Scott , etc ., by \u201c Harroviensis . \u201d Byron welcomed such a \u201c Defender of the Faith , \u201d and was anxious that Murray should print the letter together with the poem . But Murray belittled the \u201c defender , \u201d and was upbraided in turn for his slowness of heartFresh combatants rushed into the fray : \u201c Philo-Milton , \u201d with a Vindication of the \u201c Paradise Lost \u201d from the charge of exculpating \u201c Cain : A Mystery , \u201d London , 1822 ; \u201c Britannicus , \u201d with a pamphlet entitled , Revolutionary Causes , etc ., and A Postscript containing Strictures on \u201c Cain , \u201d etc ., London , 1822 , etc . ; but their works , which hardly deserve to be catalogued , have perished with them . Finally , in 1830 , a barrister named Harding Grant , author of Chancery Practice , compiled a workof more than four hundred pages , in which he treats \u201c the proceedings and speeches of Lucifer with the same earnestness as if they were existing and earthly personages . \u201d But it was \u201c a week too late . \u201d The \u201c Coryph\u00e6us of the Satanic School \u201d had passed away , and the tumult had \u201c dwindled to a calm . \u201d Cain \u201c appeared in conjunction with \u201d Sardanapalus and The Two Foscari , December 19 , 1821 . Last but not least of the three plays , it had been announced \u201c by a separate advertisement, for the purpose of exciting the greater curiosity \u201d, 1822 , p. 383 ) , and it was no sooner published than it was pirated . In the following January , \u201c Cain : A Mystery , by the author of Don Juan , \u201d was issued by W. Benbow , at Castle Street , Leicester SquareMurray had paid Byron \u00a3 2710 for the three tragedies , and in order to protect the copyright , he applied , through counsel, for an injunction in Chancery to stop the sale of piratical editions of Cain . In delivering judgment, the Chancellor , Lord Eldon, replying to Shadwell , drew a comparison between Cain and Paradise Lost , \u201c which he had read from beginning to end during the course of the last Long Vacation \u2014 solicit\u00e6 jucunda oblivia vit\u00e6 . \u201d No one , he argued , could deny that the object and effects of Paradise Lost were \u201c not to bring into disrepute , \u201d but \u201c to promote reverence for our religion , \u201d and , per contra , no one could affirm that it was impossible to arrive at an opposite conclusion with regard to \u201c the Preface , the poem , the general tone and manner of Cain . \u201d It was a question for a jury . A jury might decide that Cain was blasphemous , and void of copyright ; and as there was a reasonable doubt in his mind as to the character of the book , and a doubt as to the conclusion at which a jury would arrive , he was compelled to refuse the injunction . According to Dr . Smiles, the decision of a jury was taken , and an injunction eventually granted . If so , it was ineffectual , for Benbow issued another edition of Cain in 1824See , too , the case of Murray v. Benbow and Another , as reported in the Examiner , February 17 , 1822 ; and cases of Wolcot v. Walker , Southey v. Sherwood , Murray v. Benbow , and Lawrence v. Smith\u201c Cain , \u201d said Moore, \u201c has made a sensation . \u201d Friends and champions , the press , the public \u201c turned up their thumbs . \u201d Gifford shook his head ; Hobhouse \u201c launched out into a most violent invective \u201d; Jeffrey , in the Edinburgh , was regretful and hortatory ; Heber , in the Quarterly , was fault-finding and contemptuous . The \u201c parsons preached at it from Kentish Town to Pisa \u201dEven \u201c the very highest authority in the land , \u201d his Majesty King George IV ., \u201c expressed his disapprobation of the blasphemy and licentiousness of Lord Byron 's writings \u201dByron himself was forced to admit that \u201c my Mont Saint Jean seems Cain \u201dThe many were unanimous in their verdict , but the higher court of the few reversed the judgment . Goethe said that \u201c Its beauty is such as we shall not see a second time in the world \u201d; Scott , in speaking of \u201c the very grand and tremendous drama of Cain , \u201d said that the author had \u201c matched Milton on his own ground \u201d; \u201c Cain , \u201d wrote Shelley to Gisborne, \u201c is apocalyptic ; it is a revelation never before communicated to man . \u201d Uncritical praise , as well as uncritical censure , belongs to the past ; but the play remains , a singular exercise of \u201c poetic energy , \u201d a confession , ex animo , of \u201c the burthen of the mystery , ... the heavy and the weary weight Of all this unintelligible world . \u201d For reviews of Cain : A Mystery , vide ante , \u201c Introduction to Sardanapalus , \u201d p. 5 ; see , too , Eclectic Review , May , 1822 , N.

TO SIR WALTER SCOTT , BART ., THIS MYSTERY OF CAIN IS INSCRIBED , BY HIS OBLIGED FRIEND AND FAITHFUL SERVANT , THE AUTHOR .PREFACE The following scenes are entitled \u201c A Mystery , \u201d in conformity with the ancient title annexed to dramas upon similar subjects , which were styled \u201c Mysteries , or Moralities . \u201dThe author has by no means taken the same liberties with his subject which were common formerly , as may be seen by any reader curious enough to refer to those very profane productions , whether in English , French , Italian , or Spanish . The author has endeavoured to preserve the language adapted to his characters ; and where it istaken from actual Scripture , he has made as little alteration , even of words , as the rhythm would permit . The reader will recollect that the book of Genesis does not state that Eve was tempted by a demon , but by \u201c the Serpent; \u201d and that only because he was \u201c the most subtil of all the beasts of the field . \u201d Whatever interpretation the Rabbins and the Fathers may have put upon this , I take the words as I find them , and reply , with Bishop Watsonupon similar occasions , when the Fathers were quoted to him as Moderator in the schools of Cambridge , \u201c Behold the Book ! \u201d \u2014 holding up the Scripture . It is to be recollected , that my present subject has nothing to do with the New Testament , to which no reference can be here made without anachronism .With the poems upon similar topics I have not been recently familiar . Since I was twenty I have never read Milton ; but I had read him so frequently before , that this may make little difference . Gesner 's \u201c Death of Abel \u201d I have never read since I was eight years of age , at Aberdeen . The general impression of my recollection is delight ; but of the contents I remember only that Cain 's wife was called Mahala , and Abel 's Thirza ; in the following pages I have called them \u201c Adah \u201d and \u201c Zillah , \u201d the earliest female names which occur in Genesis . They were those of Lamech 's wives : those of Cain and Abel are not called by their names . Whether , then , a coincidence of subject may have caused the same in expression , I know nothing , and care as little .am prepared to be accused of Manicheism ,or some other hard name ending in ism , which makes a formidable figure and awful sound in the eyes and ears of those who would be as much puzzled to explain the terms so bandied about , as the liberal and pious indulgers in such epithets . Against such I can defend myself , or , if necessary , I can attack in turn . \u201c Claw for claw , as Conan said to Satan and the deevil take the shortest nails \u201d] The reader will please to bear in mind, that there is no allusion to a future state in any of the books of Moses , nor indeed in the Old Testament . For a reason for this extraordinary omission he may consult Warburton 's \u201c Divine Legation ; \u201dwhether satisfactory or not , no better has yet been assigned . I have therefore supposed it new to Cain , without , I hope , any perversion of Holy Writ . With regard to the language of Lucifer , it was difficult for me to make him talk like a clergyman upon the same subjects ; but I have done what I could to restrain him within the bounds of spiritual politeness . If he disclaims having tempted Eve in the shape of the Serpent , it is only because the book of Genesis has not the most distant allusion to anything of the kind , but merely to the Serpent in his serpentine capacity .", "Because we have waited long enough , and he", "to beg him", "And I \u2014\u2014", "The busy have no time for tears .", "Right ! 350", "In his own portion of the palace , with", "Sires of a hundred sons , but cannot kindle", "An atom of their ancestors from earth .", "\u2018 Twas fit that some one of such different thoughts", "Well , sir !", "That he has paid me !Chief of the Ten .

S. Romaninand R. Sengertake the same view . On the other hand , Miss A. Wielpoints out that , according to the Dolfin Cronaca , which Berlan did not consult , Jacopo was in a \u201c mutilated \u201d condition when the trial was over , and he was permitted to take a last farewell of his wife and children in Torricella . Goethedid not share Eckermann 's astonishment that Byron \u201c could dwell so long on this torturing subject . \u201d \u201c He was always a self-tormentor , and hence such subjects were his darling theme . \u201d ]{ 122 }quando tractatur de rebus tangentibus ad attinentes Domini Ducis . \u201d The fact that \u201c Nos Franciscus Foscari , \u201d etc ., stood at the commencement of the decree of exile may have given rise to the tradition that the Doge , like a Roman father , tried and condemned his son .]{ 123 }Not long afterwards Marco Loredano , the admiral 's brother , met with a somewhat similar fate . He had been despatched by the X. to Legnano , to investigate the conduct of Andrea Donate , the Doge 's brother-in-law , who was suspected of having embezzled the public moneys . His report was unfavourable to Donato , and , shortly after , he too fell sick and died . It is most improbable that the Doge was directly or indirectly responsible for the death of either brother ; but there was an hereditary feud , and the libellous epitaph was a move in the game . ]{ 124 }4 \u2014\u2014 checked by nought The vessel that creaks \u2014\u2014.\u2014{ 125 } \u2014\u2014 much pity .\u2014{ 126 } In this brief colloquy , and must redeem it .\u2014\u201c And I have loved thee , Ocean ! and my joy Of youthful sports was on thy breast to be Borne , like thy bubbles , onward : from a boy I wantoned with thy breakers . \u201d Childe Harold , Canto IV . stanza clxxxiv . lines 1-4 , Poetical Works , 1899 , ii . 461 , note 2 . ]{ 127 }I see your colour comes .\u2014{ 130 }\u2014 \u2018 A daughter of the house that now among Its ancestors in monumental brass Numbers eight Doges . \u2019 On the occasion of her marriage the Bucentaur came out in its splendour ; and a bridge of boats was thrown across the Canal Grande for the bridegroom and his retinue of three hundred horse . \u201d \u2014 Foscari , by Samuel Rogers , Poems , 1852 , ii . 93 , note .

He had been despatched by the X. to Legnano , to investigate the conduct of Andrea Donate , the Doge 's brother-in-law , who was suspected of having embezzled the public moneys . His report was unfavourable to Donato , and , shortly after , he too fell sick and died .

He replied in these words \u2014 \u201c Edinburgh , 4th December , 1821 . \u201c My Dear Sir ,\u2014 I accept , with feelings of great obligation , the flattering proposal of Lord Byron to prefix my name to the very grand and tremendous drama of \u2018 Cain . \u2019I may be partial to it , and you will allow I have cause ; but I do not know that his Muse has ever taken so lofty a flight amid her former soarings . He has certainly matched Milton on his own ground . Some part of the language is bold , and may shock one class of readers , whose line will be adopted by others out of affectation or envy . But then they must condemn the \u2018 Paradise Lost , \u2019 if they have a mind to be consistent . The fiend-like reasoning and bold blasphemy of the fiend and of his pupil lead exactly to the point which was to be expected ,\u2014 the commission of the first murder , and the ruin and despair of the perpetrator . \u201c I do not see how any one can accuse the author himself of Manicheism . The Devil talks the language of that sect , doubtless ; because , not being able to deny the existence of the Good Principle , he endeavours to exalt himself \u2014 the Evil Principle \u2014 to a seeming equality with the Good ; but such arguments , in the mouth of such a being , can only be used to deceive and to betray . Lord Byron might have made this more evident , by placing in the mouth of Adam , or of some good and protecting spirit , the reasons which render the existence of moral evil consistent with the general benevolence of the Deity . The great key to the mystery is , perhaps , the imperfection of our own faculties , which see and feel strongly the partial evils which press upon us , but know too little of the general system of the universe , to be aware how the existence of these is to be reconciled with the benevolence of the great Creator . \u201c To drop these speculations , you have much occasion for some mighty spirit , like Lord Byron , to come down and trouble the waters ; for , excepting \u2018 The John Bull , \u2019you seem stagnating strangely in London . \u201c Yours , my dear Sir , \u201c Very truly , \u201c WALTER SCOTT . \u201c To John Murray , Esq . \u201d -Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott , by J. G. Lockhart , Esq ., 1838 , iii . 92 , 93 .\u201c However , the praise often given to Byron has been so exaggerated as to provoke , perhaps , a reaction in which he is unduly disparaged . \u2018 As various in composition as Shakespeare himself , Lord Byron has embraced , \u2019 says Sir Walter Scott , \u2018 every topic of human life , and sounded every string on the divine harp , from its slightest to its most powerful and heart-astounding tones .... In the very grand and tremendous drama of Cain , \u2019 etc .... \u2018 And Lord Byron has done all this , \u2019 Scott adds , \u2018 while managing his pen with the careless and negligent ease of a man of quality . \u2019 \u201d \u2014 Poetry of Byron , chosen and arranged by Matthew Arnold , 1881 , p. xiii . Scott does not add anything of the kind . The comparison with Shakespeare was written after Byron 's death in May , 1824 ; the appreciation of Cain in December , 1821; while the allusion to \u201c a man of quality \u201d is to be found in an article contributed to the Quarterly Review in 1816 ! ]The first number of John Bull , \u201c For God , the King , and the People , \u201d was published Sunday , December 17 , 1820 . Theodore Hook was the editor , and it is supposed that he owed his appointment to the intervention of Sir Walter Scott . The raison d'\u00eatre of John Bull was to write up George IV ., and to write down Queen Caroline . \u201c The national movementwas arrested ; and George IV . had mainly John Bull to thank for that result . \u201d \u2014 A Sketch ,, 1852 , p . 45 . ]]{ 207 }, printed in Stevens 's continuation of Dugdale 's Monasticon , 1722 , i . 139-153 . There is a sixteenth-century edition of Le Mist\u00e8re du Viel Testament , which was reprinted by the Baron James de Rothschild , in 1878; but it is improbable that it had come under Byron 's notice .

Alexander Geddes , LL. D ., 1800 , p . 42 . ], Bishop of Llandaff , 1782 , was appointed Moderator of the Schools in 1762 , and Regius Professor of Divinity October 31 , 1771 . According to his own story, \u201c I determined to study nothing but my Bible .... I had no prejudice against , no predilection for , the Church of England , but a sincere regard for the Church of Christ , and an insuperable objection to every degree of dogmatical intolerance . I never troubled myself with answering any arguments which the opponents in the Divinity Schools brought against the articles of the Church , ... but I used on such occasions to say to them , holding the New Testament in my hand , \u2018 En sacrum codicem ! Here is the foundation of truth ! Why do you follow the streams derived from it by the sophistry , or polluted by the passions , of man ? \u2019 \u201d It may be conceived that Watson 's appeal to \u201c Scripture \u201d was against the sentence of orthodoxy . His authority as \u201c a school Divine \u201d is on a par with that of the author of Cain , or of an earlier theologian who \u201c quoted Genesis like a very learned clerk \u201d ! ]{ 209 }held that there were two co-eternal Creators \u2014 a God of Darkness who made the body , and a God of Light who was responsible for the soul \u2014 and that it was the aim and function of the good spirit to rescue the soul , the spiritual part of man , from the possession and grasp of the body , which had been created by and was in the possession of the spirit of evil . St. Augustine passed through a stage of Manicheism , and in after-life exposed and refuted the heretical tenets which he had advocated , and with which he was familiar . See , for instance , his account of the Manich\u00e6an heresy \u201c de duplici terr\u00e2 , de regno lucis et regno tenebrarum \u201d]\" Sometimes the proverb is worded thus : \u201c \u2018 Claw for claw , and the devil take the shortest nails , \u2019 as Conan said to the devil . \u201d \u2014 Waverley Novels , 1829, i . 241 , note 1 ; see , too , ibid ., p . 229 . ], Vol .

Opera-tragedy would , in his opinion , be a fitting name for it ; but he prefers interpolating the word \u2018 melo \u2019 into the middle of the word \u2018 tragedy , \u2019 so as not to spoil the ending , although by so doing he has cut in two ... the root of the word \u2014 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2\u201c \u2014 The Tragedies of Vittorio Alfieri , edited by E.

The appearance of the land strangled by the ocean will serve by way of scenery and decorations . The affectionate tenderness of Adah for those from whom she is parted , and for ever , and her fears contrasting with the loftier spirit of Aholibamah triumphing in the hopes of a new and greater destiny will make the dialogue . They , in the meantime , continue their a\u00ebrial voyage , everywhere denied admittance in those floating islands over the sea of space , and driven back by guardian-spirits of the different planets , till they are at length forced to alight on the only peak of the earth uncovered by water . Here a parting takes place between the lovers .... The fallen angels are suddenly called , and condemned , their destination and punishment unknown . The sisters cling to the rock , the waters mounting higher and higher . Now enter Ark . The scene draws up , and discovers Japhet endeavouring to persuade the Patriarch , with very strong arguments of love and pity , to receive the sisters , or at least Adah , on board . Adah joins in his entreaties , and endeavours to cling to the sides of the vessel . The proud and haughty Aholibamah scorns to pray either to God or man , and anticipates the grave by plunging into the waters . Noah is still inexorable .is momentarily in danger of perishing before the eyes of the Arkites . Japhet is in despair . The last wave sweeps her from the rock , and her lifeless corpse floats past in all its beauty , whilst a sea-bird screams over it , and seems to be the spirit of her angel lord . I once thought of conveying the lovers to the moon or one of the planets ; but it is not easy for the imagination to make any unknown world more beautiful than this ; besides , I did not think they would approve of the moon as a residence . I remember what Fontenelle said of its having no atmosphere , and the dark spots having caverns where the inhabitants reside . There was another objection : all the human interest would have been destroyed , which I have even endeavoured to give my angels . \u201d ] WERNER ; OR , THE INHERITANCE : A TRAGEDY .Werner was brought out at Drury Lane Theatre , and played , for the first time , December 15 , 1830 . Macready appeared as \u201c Werner , \u201d J. W. Wallack as \u201c Ulric , \u201d Mrs. Faucit as \u201c Josephine , \u201d and Miss Mordaunt as \u201c Ida . \u201d According to the Times , December 16 , 1830 , \u201c Mr. Macready appeared to very great advantage . We have never seen him exert himself more \u2014 we have never known him to exert himself with more powerful effect . Three of his scenes were masterpieces . \u201d Genest says that Werner was acted seventeen times in 1830-31 . There was a revival in 1833 . Macready saysthat he acted \u201c \u2018 Werner \u2019 with unusual force , truth , and collectedness ... finished off each burst of passion , and , in consequence , entered on the following emotion with clearness and earnestness \u201dWerner was played in 1834 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 9 ; in 1841 ; in 1843-4; in 1845; in 1846 , 1847 ; in America in 1848 ; in the provinces in 1849 ; in 1850 ; and , for the last time , at the Theatre Royal , Haymarket , January 14 , 1851 . At the farewell performance Macready appeared as \u201c Werner , \u201d Mr. Davenport as \u201c Ulric , \u201d Mrs. Warner as \u201c Josephine , \u201d Mrs. Ryder as \u201c Ida . \u201d In the same yeara portrait of Macready as \u201c Werner , \u201d by Daniel Maclise , R. A ., was on view at the Exhibition at the Royal Academy . The motto was taken from Werner , act i. sc . 1 , lines 114 , sq .Werner was brought out at Sadler 's Wells Theatre , November 21 , 1860 , and repeated November 22 , 23 , 24 , 28 , 29 ; December , 3 , 4 , 11 , 13 , 14 , 1860 . Phelps appeared as \u201c Werner , \u201d Mr. Edmund Phelps as \u201c Ulric , \u201d Miss Atkinson as \u201c Josephine . \u201d \u201c Perhaps the old actor never performed the part so finely as he did on that night . The identity between the real and ideal relations of the characters was as vivid to him as to the audience , and gave a deeper intensity , on both sides , to the scenes between father and son . \u201dOn the afternoon of June 1 , 1887 , Wernerwas performed at the Lyceum Theatre for the benefit of Westland Marston .Henry Irving appeared as \u201c Werner , \u201d Miss Ellen Terry as \u201c Josephine , \u201d Mr. Alexander as \u201c Ulric . \u201d] INTRODUCTION TO WERNER . Werner ; or , The Inheritance , was begun at Pisa , December 18 , 1821 , and finished January 20 , 1822 . At the end of the month , January 29 , Byron despatched the MS ., not to Murray , but to Moore , then in retreat at Paris , intending , no doubt , that it should be placed in the hands of another publisher ; but a letter from Murray \u201c melted him , \u201d and on March 6 , 1822, he desired Moore to forward the packet to Albemarle Street . The play was set up in type , and revised proofs were returned to Murray at the end of June ; but , for various reasons , publication was withheld , and , on October 31 , Byron informed John Hunt that he had empowered his friend Douglas Kinnaird to obtain Werner , with other MSS ., from Murray . None the less , milder counsels again prevailed , and on Saturday , November 23 , 1822 , Werner was published , not in the same volume with Heaven and Earth , as Byron intended and expected , nor by John Hunt , as he had threatened , but by itself , and , as heretofore , by John Murray . Werner was \u201c the last of all the flock \u201d to issue from Murray 's fold . In his Preface to WernerByron disclaims all pretensions to originality . \u201c The following drama , \u201d he writes , \u201c is taken entirely from the \u2018 German 's Tale , Kruitzner , \u2019 published ... in Lee 's Canterbury Tales .... I have adopted the characters , plan , and even the language , of many parts of this story . \u201d Kruitzner seems to have made a deep impression on his mind . When he was a boy of thirteen, and again in 1815 , he set himself to turn the tale into a drama . His first attempt , named Ulric and Ilvina , he threw into the fire , but he had nearly completed the first act of his second and maturer adaptation when he was \u201c interrupted by circumstances , \u201d that is , no doubt , the circumstances which led up to and ended in the separation from his wife .On his leaving England for the Continent , April 25 , 1816 , the fragment was left behind . Most probably the MS. fell into his sister 's hands , for in October , 1821 , it was not forthcoming when Byron gave directions that Hobhouse should search for it \u201c amongst my papers . \u201d Ultimately it came into the possession of the late Mr. Murray , and is now printed for the first time in its entiretyIt should be borne in mind that this unprinted first act of Werner , which synchronizes with the Siege of Corinth and Parisina , was written when Byron was a member of the sub-committee of management of Drury Lane Theatre , and , as the numerous stage directions testify , with a view to stage-representation . The MS. is scored with corrections , and betrays an unusual elaboration , and , perhaps , some difficulty and hesitation in the choice of words and the construction of sentences . In the opening scene the situation is not caught and gripped , while the melancholy squalor of the original narrative is only too faithfully reproduced . The Werner of 1821 , with all its shortcomings , is the production of a playwright . The Werner of 1815 is the attempt of a highly gifted amateur . When Byron once more bethought himself of his old subject , he not only sent for the MS. of the first act , but desired Murray \u201c to cut out Sophia Lee 's \u201d\u201c German 's Tale from the Canterbury Tales , and send it in a letter \u201dHe seems to have intended from the first to construct a drama out of the story , and , no doubt , to acknowledge the source of his inspiration . On the whole , he carried out his intention , taking places , characters , and incidents as he found them , but recasting the materials and turning prose into metre . But here and there , to save himself trouble , he \u201c stole his brooms ready made , \u201d and , as he acknowledges in the Preface , \u201c adopted even the language of the story . \u201d Act ii . sc . 2 , lines 87-172 ; act iii . sc . 4 ; and act v. sc . 1 , lines 94-479 , are , more or less , faithful and exact reproductions of pp . 203-206 , 228-232 , and 252-271 of the novelOn the other hand , in the remaining three-fourths of the play , the language is not Miss Lee 's , but Byron 's , and the \u201c conveyance \u201d of incidents occasional and insignificant . Much , too , was imported into the play, of which there is neither hint nor suggestion in the story . Maginn 's categorical statementthat \u201c here Lord Byron has invented nothing \u2014 absolutely , positively , undeniably NOTHING ; \u201d that \u201c there is not one incident in his play , not even the most trivial , that is not to be found in the novel , \u201d etc ., is \u201c positively and undeniably \u201d a falsehood . Maginn read Werner for the purpose of attacking Byron , and , by printing selected passages from the novel and the play , in parallel columns , gives the reader to understand that he had made an exhaustive analysis of the original and the copy . The review , which is quoted as an authority in the editions of 1832and 1837 , etc ., p. 341 , is disingenuous and misleading . The original story may be briefly retold . The prodigal and outlawed son of a Bohemian noble , Count Siegendorf , after various adventures , marries , under the assumed name of Friedrich Kruitzner , the daughter of an Italian scholar and man of science , of noble birth , but in narrow circumstances . A son , Conrad , is born to him , who , at eight years of age , is transferred to the charge of his grandfather . Twelve years go by , and , when the fortunes of the younger Siegendorf are at their lowest ebb , he learns , at the same moment , that his father is dead , and that a distant kinsman , the Baron Stralenheim , is meditating an attack on his person , with a view to claiming his inheritance . Of Conrad , who has disappeared , he hears nothing . An accident compels the count and the baron to occupy adjoining quarters in a small town on the northern frontier of Silesia ; and , again , another accident places the usurping and intriguing baron at the mercy of his poverty-stricken and exiled kinsman . Stralenheim has fallen asleep near the fire in his easy-chair . Papers and several rouleaux of gold are ranged on a cabinet beside the bed . Kruitzner , who is armed with \u201c a large and sharp knife , \u201d is suddenly confronted with his unarmed and slumbering foe , and though habit and conscience conspire to make murder impossible , he yields to a sudden and irresistible impulse , and snatches up \u201c the portion of gold which is nearest . \u201d He has no sooner returned to his wife and confessed his deed , than Conrad suddenly appears on the scene , and at the very moment of an unexpected and joyous reunion with his parents , learns that his father is a thief . Kruitzner pleads \u201c guilty with extenuating circumstances , \u201d and Conrad , who either is or pretends to be disgusted at his father 's sophistries , makes the best of a bad business , and undertakes to conceal his father 's dishonour and rescue him from the power of Stralenheim . The plot hinges on the unlooked-for and unsuspected action of Conrad . Unlike his father , he is not the man to let \u201c I dare not wait upon I would , \u201d but murders Stralenheim in cold blood , and , at the same time , diverts suspicion from his father and himself to the person of his comrade , a Hungarian soldier of fortune , who is already supposed to be the thief , and who had sought and obtained shelter in the apartments of the conscience-stricken Kruitzner . The scene changes to Prague . Siegendorf , no longer Kruitzner , has regained his inheritance , and is once more at the height of splendour and prosperity . A service of thanksgiving is being held in the cathedral to commemorate the signature of the Treaty of Prague, and the count is present in state . Suddenly he catches sight of the Hungarian , and , \u201c like a flash of lightning \u201d feels and remembers that he is a thief , and that he might , however unjustly , be suspected if not accused of the murder of Stralenheim . The service is over , and the count is recrossing \u201c Muldau 's Bridge , \u201d when he hears the fatal word Kruitzner , \u201c the seal of his shame , \u201d spoken in his ear . He returns to his castle , and issues orders that the Hungarian should be arrested and interrogated . An interview takes place , at which the Hungarian denounces Conrad as the murderer of Stralenheim . The son acknowledges the deed , and upbraids the father for his weakness and credulity in supposing that his escape from Stralenheim 's machinations could have been effected by any other means . If , he argues , circumstances can palliate dishonesty , they can compel and justify murder . Common sense even now demands the immediate slaughter of the Hungarian , as it compelled and sanctioned the effectual silencing of Stralenheim . But Siegendorf knows not \u201c thorough , \u201d and shrinks at assassination . He repudiates and denounces his son , and connives at the escape of the Hungarian . Conrad , who is banished from Prague , rejoins his former associates , the \u201c black bands , \u201d which were the scandal and terror of the neighbouring provinces , and is killed in a skirmish with the regular troops . Siegendorf dies of a broken heart . The conception of The German 's Tale , as Byron perceived , is superior to the execution . The style is laboured and involved , and the narrative long-winded and tiresome . It is , perhaps , an adaptation , though not a literal translation , of a German historical romance . But the motif \u2014 a son predestined to evil by the weakness and sensuality of his father , a father punished for his want of rectitude by the passionate criminality of his son , is the very key-note of tragedy . If from haste or indolence Byron scamped his task , and cut up whole cantles of the novel into nerveless and pointless blank verse , here and there throughout the play , in scattered lines and passages , he outdoes himself . The inspiration is fitful , but supreme . Werner was reviewed in Blackwood 's Edinburgh Magazine , December , 1822 , vol . xii . pp . 710-719; in the Scots Magazine , December , 1822 , N. S . vol . xi . pp . 688-694 ; the European Magazine , January , 1823 , vol . 83 , pp . 73-76 ; and in the Eclectic Review , February , 1823 , N. S . vol . xix . pp . 148-155 . NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO WERNER . In an article entitled , \u201c Did Byron write Werner ? \u201d which appeared in the Nineteenth Century, the Hon . F. Leveson Gower undertakes to prove that Werner was not written by Lord Byron , but by Georgiana , Duchess of DevonshireHe adduces , in support of this claim ,a statement made to him by his sister , the late Lady Georgiana Fullerton , to the effect that their grandmother , the duchess , \u201c wrote the poem and gave the MS. to her niece , Lady Caroline Ponsonby, and that she , some years later , handed it over to Lord Byron , who , in 1822 , published it in his own name ; \u201da letter written in 1822 by his mother , Lady Granville , to her sister , Lady Carlisle , which asserts that their mother , the duchess , \u201c wrote an entire tragedy from Miss Lee 's Kreutzner the Hungarian, \u201d and that the MS. had been sent to her by Lady Caroline 's brother , Mr. William Ponsonby , and was in her possession ;another letter of Lady Granville 's , dated December 3 , 1822 , in which she informs her sister that her husband , Lord Granville , had promised to read Werner aloud to her, a promise which , if fulfilled , must have revealed one of two things \u2014 the existence of two dramas based on Miss Lee 's Kruitzner , or the identity of Byron 's version with that of the duchess . Now , argues Mr. Leveson Gower , if Lady Granville had known that two dramas were in existence , she would not have allowed her daughter , Lady Georgiana Fullerton , to believe \u201c that the duchess was the author of the published poem . \u201d I will deal with the external evidence first . Practically it amounts to this :that Lady Granville knew that her mother , the Duchess of Devonshire , dramatized Miss Lee 's Kruitzner ; andthat Lady Georgiana Fullerton believed that the duchess gave the MS. of her play to Lady Caroline Ponsonby , and that , many years after , Lady Caroline handed it over to Byron . The external evidence establishes the fact that the Duchess of Devonshire dramatized Kruitzner , but it does not prove that Byron purloined her adaptation . It records an unverified impression on the part of the duchess 's granddaughter , that the MS. of a play written between the years 1801-1806 , passed into Byron 's hands about the year 1813 ; that he took a copy of the MS .; and that in 1821-22 he caused his copy to be retranscribed and published under his own name ."]}, "act_index": 217, "play_index": 15}, {"data": {"1411": ["My heart 's first choice ;\u2014 which chose thee , knowing neither", "It would be", "Or , if it were so , how 650", "How should we ?", "Millions of myriads feel it \u2014 cheerfully ;", "And art thou not now sheltered from them all ?

The end of the fifth act and the Drama . B. P. J ^ y 20 , 1822 . FOOTNOTES :{ 337 }, the younger of the sisters . Miss Lee began her literary career as a dramatist . A comedy , The New Peerage ; or , Our Eyes may deceive us , was played at Drury Lane , November 10 , 1787 . In 1798 she published The Mysterious Marriage ; or , The Heirship of Rosalva . After the publication of Byron 's Werner , she wrote a dramatic version of The German 's Tale , under the title of The Three Strangers . It was brought out at Covent Garden , December 10 , 1825 , and acted four times . The first volume of the Canterbury Tales , by Harriet Lee , was published in 1797 ; the second volume , by Sophia Lee , in 1798; a third volume, by Sophia and Harriet Lee , appeared in 1800 ; the fourth volume , by Harriet Leewas published in 1801 ; and the fifth volume , by Harriet Lee , in 1805 . There can be little doubt that Byron 's visit to Churchill 's grave at Dover , which took place April 25 , 1816, was suggested by a passage in the Introduction , pp . vii. - ix ., to the first volumeof the Canterbury Tales . The author \u201c wanders forth to note the memorabilia of Dover , \u201d is informed that \u201c the greatest curiosity in the place is the tomb of a poet , \u201d and hastens \u201c to a spot surrounded by ruined walls , in the midst of which stood the white marble tablet marked with Churchill 's name , \u201d etc . ]{ 338 }folly which may injure me \u2014 andno one . If it be understood that all dramatic writing is generically intended for the stage , I deny itWith the exception of Shakespeare, not one in fifty plays of our dramatists is ever acted , however much they may be read . Only one of Massinger \u2014 none of Ford \u2014 none of Marlowe , one of Ben Jonson \u2014 none of Webster , none of Heywood : and , even in Comedy , Congreve is rarely acted , and that in only one of his plays . Neither is Joanna Baillie . I am far from attempting to raise myself to a level with the least of these names \u2014 I only wish to befrom a stage which is not theirs . Perhaps Mr. Lamb 's essay upon the effects of dramatic representation on the intelligent auditor\u2014\u2014 marks are just with regard to this \u2014 plays of Shakespeare himself \u2014 the hundredfold to those of others .\u2014 From a mutilated page of MS. M .]\u201c A drama is not merely a dialogue , but an action : and necessarily supposes that something is to pass before the eyes of assembled spectators .... If an author does not bear this continually in his mind , and does not write in the ideal presence of an eager and diversified assemblage , he may be a poet , perhaps , but assuredly he will never be a dramatist . \u201d ]{ 340 }{ 342 } Yea \u2014 to a peasant .\u2014{ 346 }, Poetical Works , 1901 , iv . 564 . ]{ 347 }, and that a similarity of character and incident suggested the renaming of Kruitzner . But the change of name was made in 1815 , not in 1821 , and it is far more probable that Byron called his hero \u201c Werner , \u201d because \u201c Kruitzner \u201d is unrhythmical , or simply because \u201c Werner , \u201d a common German surname , is not unlike \u201c Werther , \u201d which was \u201c familiar as a household word . \u201d ]{ 348 }{ 349 }{ 351 }{ 352 }{ 354 }{ 355 } Without means and he has not a stiver left .\u2014{ 357 } This is one of those to whom I owe aid .\u2014{ 364 }{ 365 }{ 367 }\u2014 Letter to Murray , May 29 , 1822 , Letters , 1901 , vi . 75 . ]{ 368 } \u2014\u2014 who furnish our good masters .\u2014{ 385 }were formed ; that these pursued on their own account the trade that they had formerly carried on under the cover of military law , and that commerce became again unsafe on the highways . \u201d \u2014 History of the Thirty Years \u2019 War , by A.
