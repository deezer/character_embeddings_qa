But why she should accuse him of unkindness towards her is not so clear , since it is she who has broken off their intimacy . Her meaning is not doubtful in Quarto I , where this reference to Hamlet 's unkindness follows upon his comments on her honesty , and evidently refers to them . But in Quarto II Shakespeare changes the order of the conversation , and so apparently intends to make Ophelia 's suggestion of unkindness refer to Hamlet 's visit to her closet . Hence he had not only frightened her at that interview , as she informed her father , but he had hurt her , she realizes that he had renounced her , and in this gentle way she now upbraids him . But Hamlet , wrought to sudden fury by the reminiscence , like Othello , can see nothing but the supposed wrong which she has done him , and , like Othello , charges her with unchastity , without indicating the suspected man :"]}, "act_index": 90, "play_index": 10}, {"data": {"538": ["No , not I ;", "Then I would you were so honest a man .", "Why \u2018 One fair daughter , and no more , the which he loved passing well . \u2019", "Ay , truly ; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd , than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness . This was sometime a paradox , but now the time gives it proof . \u201d Though expressed figuratively , there can be no doubt of Hamlet 's intention in this passage to warn Ophelia against some temptation then assailing her , which is attacking her virtue through the medium of her beauty , and which will probably prevail over it . It concerns her \u201c honesty , \u201d \u2014 a virtuous woman being honest in respect of others who have claims on her , and chaste in respect of herself ,\u2014 and undoubtedly it refers to the temptation which assails all women who win unscrupulous admirers by their charms , and to which they sometimes succumb . In Ophelia 's case it has been to Hamlet an impossible possibility that she could prove unfaithful to him , but here and now , since he has discovered her secret visit to the King , it has become reality . Then , as the scene proceeds , Hamlet in a breath admits and denies his former love for her , thus plainly repudiating any present affection .Here he renounces her in words , as formerly he had renounced her by signs . Then he denounces himself and his \u201c old stock \u201d as being without virtue , and concludes the subject by declaring : \u201c We are arrant knaves , all ; believe none of us . Go thy ways to a nunnery . \u201d Here he unmistakeably warns her against the King , for of that old stock only they two are left . To the blandishments of both she has yielded , as he supposes , and since Hamlet no longer loves her , and the King but lusts after her , her only safe retreat is in a nunnery . In those old days a nunnery was often the only refuge for a woman who was fancied by a king , if she would retain her purity . At this juncture Hamlet discovers Polonius , as is evident by his suggestion that he had better remain at home when he desires to play the fool ; if the remark were not intended for his ear , it would be absurd . Of course he realizes that Polonius has been listening to their conversation , but he does not betray his knowledge , though the rest of his comments are perhaps more particularly intended for Polonius 's ear . His words turn \u201c wild and whirling , \u201d Ophelia notes the change , and her responses change in tone accordingly . He protests that though she marries she must lose that immediate jewel of her soul of which Iago prates , or that she will transform her husband into the horned monster of Othello 's fears . And then he inveighs against wanton womankind in general , but in such terms as might befit the woman he supposes that she has become . He puts on \u201c an antic disposition \u201d for the benefit of Polonius , but under it all is the pointed notice to Ophelia that their past relationship can never be renewed , and the masked charge that it is her adoption of the ways of her frail sisters that has made him mad ,\u2014 as her words indicate that she supposes him to be ,\u2014 and that has wrecked the future happiness of both of them . When Hero is charged by Claudio with unchastity , she fancies that something must be wrong with him , and says : \u201c Is my lord well , that he doth speak so wild ? \u201d Of Othello 's accusation Desdemona thinks that \u201c something , sure , of state ... Hath puddled his clear spirit . \u201d In a similar frame of mind Ophelia entreats : \u201c Ye heavenly powers restore him , \u201d and bewails the overthrow of Hamlet 's reason . These three tender hearted women are singularly alike in their mental attitudes under the accusation , and but too willing to extenuate the cruel blow and to forgive it . But both Hero and Desdemona defend themselves against the charge , whilst Ophelia , maintaining her habitual reticence , neither admits nor denies anything , and Hamlet 's conviction of her wrongdoing with the King remains unchanged . Thus far Hamlet has made no direct charge of the transfer of Ophelia 's affections from him to another , but he seems to do this at their next interview , which takes place at the time of the play of \u2018 Gonzago 's Murder . \u2019 There is a bitterness towards her in his speech , a brutality in his obscene allusions , and a degree of heartlessness in it all , which can be excused \u2014 if indeed it be deemed excusable \u2014 only on the theory that he believes her to have herself become a heartless , wicked woman . When he is commenting on the facts of the play , and Ophelia suggests that he is \u201c as good as a chorus , \u201d he snarlingly replies : \u201c I could interpret between you and your love if I could see the puppets dallying . \u201d Everything which Hamlet says is pregnant with meaning , and Ophelia evidently regards this as a keen thrust at her , which it plainly is . Both of them know that they two are no longer lovers , and each of them therefore understands that the allusion is to some other man with whom she treads \u201c the primrose path of dalliance . \u201d As usual Ophelia does not deny the charge , and it would not be singular if Hamlet were to accept her silence as an admission of its truth . To whom she thinks that he refers does not appear , but there can be no doubt that his conviction is that her new lover is the King . The next incident indicating this conviction is the interview in which Polonius undertakes with much complacency to \u201c board \u201d the Prince :", "Ay , sir ; to be honest , as this world goes , is to be one man picked out of ten thousand .", "Am I not i \u2019 the right , old Jephthah ?", "Excellent well ; you are a fishmonger .", "Are you fair ?"]}, "act_index": 90, "play_index": 10}, {"data": {"539": ["What treasure had he , my lord ?", "Do you know me , my lord ?", "I love passing well .", "Not I , my lord .", "Still on my daughter", "What follows then , my lord ?"]}, "act_index": 90, "play_index": 10}, {"data": {"540": ["George Brown , in his Emerson primer , thinks that the key-thought of \u2018 Rhea \u2019 is in these lines from \u2018 The World-Soul \u2019 about the gods :\u2014 \u201c To him who scorns their charities Their arms fly open wide . \u201d But the parallelism somewhat halts . For mark : In the one case Napoleon 's maxim is embodied , that God is on the side of the strongest battalions . The one who scorns the favoritisms and alms of Heaven , and yet , will he nill he , receives its aid , is really the strong God himself in mask , the noble and resolute man executing his will in time and space . But in the case supposed in \u2018 Rhea , \u2019 of husband and wife , the ones who scorn love are those not deserving of gifts at all, but persons who receive gifts in charity from one altruistically nobler than themselves . It is just this idea of sublime self-sacrifice that gives to \u2018 Rhea \u2019 its strange subtlety and its uniqueness among poems on love . There is a consolatory under-thought in the palimpsest , too . By his illustration of the god and the mortal maid the poet wishes Rhea to divine that , if wives make moan over husbands \u2019 lost love , husbands no less often have reason to lament the cooled affection of wives . The central idea in \u2018 Uriel \u2019 is that there is no such thing as evil . This thesis is put into the mouth of Uriel , one of the seven archangels , because he was the \u201c interpreter \u201d of God 's will . So Milton says , in the locus classicus on Uriel in Book III of \u2018 Paradise Lost . \u2019 He also says he was \u201c The sharpest-sighted spirit of all in heav'n . \u201d His station was in the all-viewing sun . Uriel , in Milton , tells how , when the universe was yet chaos , \u201c Or ever the wild Time coined itself Into calendar months and days , \u201d he saw the worlds a-forming ,\u2014 earth , sun , and stars . Emersontakes Milton at his word , and leads us back into that dark backward and abysm of time , and lets us overhear a conversation between Uriel and the other seraphs . At his speech \u201c the gods shook , \u201d because if there is no sin , if all comes round to good , even a lie , then good-bye gods , hells and heavens , and their punishments . But note that , though the All turns your wrong to good in the end , yet you , an individual , suffer for your wrongdoing . In a genial paper in the Andover Review for March , 1887 , Dr. C. C. Everett says that Dr . Hedge suggested to him that \u2018 Uriel \u2019 probably took its origin in the discussions of the Boston Association of Ministers on the theme, \u201c There is no line in nature \": all is circular , and by the law of reaction every deed returns upon the doer . At any rate , it was written in 1838 , soon after his Divinity School Address .The god of boundaries in ancient Rome \u2014 Terminus \u2014 gives his name to the cheeriest of monodies or anchoring songs sung by the gayest of old sailors on the sea of eternity , and at last approaching port . Terminus , like Hermes , the Greek god of bounds , was shown in his statues without hands or feet , to indicate that he never moved . Was Emerson a little rusty in his classical lore , or did he boldly and knowingly defy classical verities when he says the divinity came to him \u201c in his fatal rounds \u201d ? He seems to have attributed to Terminus patrolling functions like those of his own New England village fence-viewers . Or , rather , speaking in noble and more adequate terms , has he not added to the world 's mythologies a new and poetical deity ,\u2014 the god of the bounds of human life , a kind of avant-courier or Death 's dragoman to announce to men their approaching end ? \u2018 Terminus \u2019 was written about 1866 , when Emerson was in or near his sixty-third year , and sixteen years before his death . William Sloane Kennedy . A DEFENCE OF BROWNING 'S LATER WORK . If a defence of Browning 's work were to include all he has written since the date when Edmund Gosse said his books were chiefly valuable as keeping alive popular interest in the poet , and as leading fresh generations of readers to what he had already published , it would needs begin as far back as 1868 ; and considering the amount of work done since that time would require at least a volume to do the subject justice . Fortunately it has long been admitted that Homer sometimes nods , though not with such awful effect as was said to attend the nods of Jove \u2014 Hence , in spite of Mr. Gosse 's undoubted eminence as a critic , we may dare to assume that in this particular instance he fell into the ancient and distinguished trick of nodding ."]}, "act_index": 90, "play_index": 10}, {"data": {"541": ["Tut-tut , dear lad , that is not the way to speak of our mentors and preceptors .

ADVERTISEMENT At Ferrara , in the Library , are preserved the original MSS . of Tasso 's Gierusalemmeand of Guarini 's Pastor Fido , with letters of Tasso , one from Titian to Ariosto , and the inkstand and chair , the tomb and the house , of the latter . But , as misfortune has a greater interest for posterity , and little or none for the cotemporary , the cell where Tasso was confined in the hospital of St. Anna attracts a more fixed attention than the residence or the monument of Ariosto \u2014 at least it had this effect on me . There are two inscriptions , one on the outer gate , the second over the cell itself , inviting , unnecessarily , the wonder and the indignation of the spectator . Ferrara is much decayed and depopulated : the castle still exists entire ; and I saw the court where Parisina and Hugo were beheaded , according to the annal of Gibbon .THE LAMENT OF TASSO .I . Long years !\u2014 It tries the thrilling frame to bear And eagle-spirit of a Child of Song \u2014 Long years of outrage \u2014 calumny \u2014 and wrong ; Imputed madness , prisoned solitude ,And the Mind 's canker in its savage mood , When the impatient thirst of light and air Parches the heart ; and the abhorred grate , Marring the sunbeams with its hideous shade , Works through the throbbing eyeball to the brain , With a hot sense of heaviness and pain ; 10 And bare , at once , Captivity displayed Stands scoffing through the never-opened gate , Which nothing through its bars admits , save day , And tasteless food , which I have eat alone Till its unsocial bitterness is gone ; And I can banquet like a beast of prey , Sullen and lonely , couching in the cave Which is my lair , and \u2014 it may be \u2014 my grave . All this hath somewhat worn me , and may wear , But must be borne . I stoop not to despair ; 20 For I have battled with mine agony , And made me wings wherewith to overfly The narrow circus of my dungeon wall , And freed the Holy Sepulchre from thrall ; And revelled among men and things divine , And poured my spirit over Palestine ,In honour of the sacred war for Him , The God who was on earth and is in Heaven , For He has strengthened me in heart and limb . That through this sufferance I might be forgiven , 30 I have employed my penance to record How Salem 's shrine was won , and how adored . II . But this is o'er \u2014 my pleasant task is done :\u2014My long-sustaining Friend of many years ! If I do blot thy final page with tears ,Know , that my sorrows have wrung from me none . But Thou , my young creation ! my Soul 's child ! Which ever playing round me came and smiled , And wooed me from myself with thy sweet sight , Thou too art gone \u2014 and so is my delight : 40 And therefore do I weep and inly bleed With this last bruise upon a broken reed . Thou too art ended \u2014 what is left me now ? For I have anguish yet to bear \u2014 and how ? I know not that \u2014 but in the innate force Of my own spirit shall be found resource . I have not sunk , for I had no remorse , Nor cause for such : they called me mad \u2014 and why ? Oh Leonora ! wilt not thou reply ?I was indeed delirious in my heart 50 To lift my love so lofty as thou art ; But still my frenzy was not of the mind : I knew my fault , and feel my punishment Not less because I suffer it unbent . That thou wert beautiful , and I not blind , Hath been the sin which shuts me from mankind ; But let them go , or torture as they will , My heart can multiply thine image still ; Successful Love may sate itself away ; The wretched are the faithful ; \u2018 t is their fate 60 To have all feeling , save the one , decay , And every passion into one dilate , As rapid rivers into Ocean pour ; But ours is fathomless , and hath no shore . III . Above me , hark ! the long and maniac cry Of minds and bodies in captivity . And hark ! the lash and the increasing howl , And the half-inarticulate blasphemy ! There be some here with worse than frenzy foul , Some who do still goad on the o'erhYpppHeNlaboured mind , 70 And dim the little light that 's left behind With needless torture , as their tyrant Will Is wound up to the lust of doing ill :With these and with their victims am I classed , \u2018 Mid sounds and sights like these long years have passed ; \u2018 Mid sights and sounds like these my life may close : So let it be \u2014 for then I shall repose . IV . I have been patient , let me be so yet ; I had forgotten half I would forget , But it revives \u2014 Oh ! would it were my lot 80 To be forgetful as I am forgot !\u2014 Feel I not wroth with those who bade me dwell In this vast Lazar-house of many woes ? Where laughter is not mirth , nor thought the mind , Nor words a language , nor ev'n men mankind ; Where cries reply to curses , shrieks to blows , And each is tortured in his separate hell \u2014 For we are crowded in our solitudes \u2014 Many , but each divided by the wall , Which echoes Madness in her babbling moods ; 90 While all can hear , none heed his neighbour 's call \u2014 None ! save that One , the veriest wretch of all , Who was not made to be the mate of these , Nor bound between Distraction and Disease . Feel I not wroth with those who placed me here ? Who have debased me in the minds of men , Debarring me the usage of my own , Blighting my life in best of its career , Branding my thoughts as things to shun and fear ? Would I not pay them back these pangs again , 100 And teach them inward Sorrow 's stifled groan ? The struggle to be calm , and cold distress , Which undermines our Stoical success ? No !\u2014 still too proud to be vindictive \u2014 I Have pardoned Princes \u2019 insults , and would die . Yes , Sister of my Sovereign ! for thy sake I weed all bitterness from out my breast , It hath no business where thou art a guest : Thy brother hates \u2014 but I can not detest ; Thou pitiest not \u2014 but I can not forsake . 110 V . Look on a love which knows not to despair , But all unquenched is still my better part , Dwelling deep in my shut and silent heart , As dwells the gathered lightning in its cloud , Encompassed with its dark and rolling shroud , Till struck ,\u2014 forth flies the all-ethereal dart ! And thus at the collision of thy name The vivid thought still flashes through my frame , And for a moment all things as they were Flit by me ;\u2014 they are gone \u2014 I am the same . 120 And yet my love without ambition grew ; I knew thy state \u2014 my station \u2014 and I knew A Princess was no love-mate for a bard ;I told it not \u2014 I breathed it not\u2014 it was Sufficient to itself , its own reward ; And if my eyes revealed it , they , alas ! Were punished by the silentness of thine , And yet I did not venture to repine . Thou wert to me a crystal-girded shrine , Worshipped at holy distance , and around 130 Hallowed and meekly kissed the saintly ground ; Not for thou wert a Princess , but that Love Had robed thee with a glory , and arrayed Thy lineaments in beauty that dismayed \u2014 Oh ! not dismayed \u2014 but awed , like One above ! And in that sweet severitythere was A something which all softness did surpass \u2014 I know not how \u2014 thy Genius mastered mine \u2014 My Star stood still before thee :\u2014 if it were Presumptuous thus to love without design , 140 That sad fatality hath cost me dear ; But thou art dearest still , and I should be Fit for this cell , which wrongs me \u2014 but for thee . The very love which locked me to my chain Hath lightened half its weight ; and for the rest , Though heavy , lent me vigour to sustain , And look to thee with undivided breast , And foil the ingenuity of Pain . VI . It is no marvel \u2014 from my very birth My soul was drunk with Love ,\u2014 which did pervade 150 And mingle with whate'er I saw on earth : Of objects all inanimate I made Idols , and out of wild and lonely flowers , And rocks , whereby they grew , a Paradise , Where I did lay me down within the shade Of waving trees , and dreamed uncounted hours , Though I was chid for wandering ; and the Wise Shook their white ag\u00e9d heads o'er me , and said Of such materials wretched men were made , And such a truant boy would end in woe , 160 And that the only lesson was a blow ;\u2014 And then they smote me , and I did not weep , But cursed them in my heart , and to my haunt Returned and wept alone , and dreamed again The visions which arise without a sleep . And with my years my soul began to pant With feelings of strange tumult and soft pain ; And the whole heart exhaled into One Want , But undefined and wandering , till the day I found the thing I sought \u2014 and that was thee ; 170 And then I lost my being , all to be Absorbed in thine ;\u2014 the world was past away ;\u2014 Thou didst annihilate the earth to me ! VII . I loved all Solitude \u2014 but little thought To spend I know not what of life , remote From all communion with existence , save The maniac and his tyrant ;\u2014 had I been Their fellow , many years ere this had seen My mind like theirs corrupted to its grave .But who hath seen me writhe , or heard me rave ? 180 Perchance in such a cell we suffer more Than the wrecked sailor on his desert shore ; The world is all before him \u2014 mine is here , Scarce twice the space they must accord my bier . What though he perish , he may lift his eye , And with a dying glance upbraid the sky ; I will not raise my own in such reproof , Although \u2018 tis clouded by my dungeon roof . VIII . Yet do I feel at times my mind decline ,But with a sense of its decay : I see 190 Unwonted lights along my prison shine , And a strange Demon ,who is vexing me With pilfering pranks and petty pains , below The feeling of the healthful and the free ; But much to One , who long hath suffered so , Sickness of heart , and narrowness of place , And all that may be borne , or can debase . I thought mine enemies had been but Man , But Spirits may be leagued with them \u2014 all Earth Abandons \u2014 Heaven forgets me ;\u2014 in the dearth 200 Of such defence the Powers of Evil can \u2014 It may be \u2014 tempt me further ,\u2014 and prevail Against the outworn creature they assail . Why in this furnace is my spirit proved , Like steel in tempering fire ? because I loved ? Because I loved what not to love , and see , Was more or less than mortal , and than me . IX . I once was quick in feeling \u2014 that is o'er ;\u2014 My scars are callous , or I should have dashed My brain against these bars , as the sun flashed 210 In mockery through them ;\u2014 -  If I bear and bore The much I have recounted , and the more Which hath no words ,\u2014 \u2018 t is that I would not die And sanction with self-slaughter the dull lie Which snared me here , and with the brand of shame Stamp Madness deep into my memory , And woo Compassion to a blighted name , Sealing the sentence which my foes proclaim . No \u2014 it shall be immortal !\u2014 and I make A future temple of my present cell , 220 Which nations yet shall visit for my sake .While thou , Ferrara ! when no longer dwell The ducal chiefs within thee , shall fall down , And crumbling piecemeal view thy hearthless halls , A Poet 's wreath shall be thine only crown ,\u2014 A Poet 's dungeon thy most far renown , While strangers wonder o'er thy unpeopled walls ! And thou , Leonora !\u2014 thou \u2014 who wert ashamed That such as I could love \u2014 who blushed to hear To less than monarchs that thou couldst be dear , 230 Go ! tell thy brother , that my heart , untamed By grief \u2014 years \u2014 weariness \u2014 and it may be A taint of that he would impute to me \u2014 From long infection of a den like this , Where the mind rots congenial with the abyss ,\u2014 Adores thee still ;\u2014 and add \u2014 that when the towers And battlements which guard his joyous hours Of banquet , dance , and revel , are forgot , Or left untended in a dull repose , This \u2014 this \u2014 shall be a consecrated spot ! 240 But Thou \u2014 when all that Birth and Beauty throws Of magic round thee is extinct \u2014 shalt have One half the laurel which o'ershades my grave .No power in death can tear our names apart , As none in life could rend thee from my heart .Yes , Leonora ! it shall be our fate To be entwinedfor ever \u2014 but too late !FOOTNOTES :{ 141 }{ 143 }to the Earl of Guilford , dated August 3 , 1817 , form part of the same volume . ], Tasso exclaims , \u201c Ah , wretched me !

Hayley 's excellent translation of the three first cantos of the Inferno, which must have been known to a previous generation , was forgotten , and with earlier experiments in terza rima , by Chaucer and the sixteenth and seventeenth century poets , neither Byron nor the British public had any familiar or definite acquaintance . But of late some interest had been awakened or revived in Dante and the Divina Commedia . Cary 's translation \u2014 begun in 1796 , but not published as a whole till 1814 \u2014 had met with a sudden and remarkable success . \u201c The work , which had been published four years , but had remained in utter obscurity , was at once eagerly sought after . About a thousand copies of the first edition , that remained on hand , were immediately disposed of ; in less than three months a new edition was called for . \u201d Moreover , the Quarterly and Edinburgh Reviews were loud in its praisesByron seems to have thought that a fragment of the Inferno , \u201c versed like the original , \u201d would challenge comparison with Cary 's rendering in blank verse , and would lend an additional interest to the \u201c Pulci Translations , and the Dante Imitation . \u201d D\u00ees aliter visum , and Byron 's translation of the episode of Francesca of Rimini , remained unpublished till it appeared in the pages of The Letters and Journals of Lord Byron , 1830 , ii . 309-311 .Russell , see Literary Souvenir , 1830 , pp . 285-287 . ) FRANCESCA DA RIMINI .

Byron had no sooner finished the first draft of Manfred than he beganto lay the foundation of another tragedy . Venice was new to him , and , on visiting the Doge 's Palace , the veiled space intended for the portrait of Marin Falier , and the \u201c Giants \u2019 Staircase , \u201d where , as he believed , \u201c he was once crowned and afterwards decapitated , \u201d had laid hold of his imagination , while the legend of the Congiura , \u201c an old man jealous and conspiring against the state of which he was ... Chief , \u201d promised a subject which the \u201c devil himself \u201d might have dramatized con amore . But other interests and ideas claimed his attention , and for more than three years the project slept . At length he slips into the postscript of a letter to Murray , dated , \u201c Ravenna , April 9 , 1820 \u201d, an intimation that he had begun \u201c a tragedy on the subject of Marino Faliero , the Doge of Venice . \u201d The \u201c Imitation of Dante , the Translation of Pulci , the Danticles , \u201d etc ., were worked off , and , in prospecting for a new vein , a fresh lode of literary ore , he passed , by a natural transition , from Italian literature to Italian history , from the romantic and humorous epopee of Pulci and Berni , to the pseudo-classic drama of Alfieri and Monti . Jealousy , as \u201c Monk \u201d Lewis had advised him, was an \u201c exhausted passion \u201d in the drama , and to lay the scene in Venice was to provoke comparison with Shakespeare and Otway ; but the man himself , the fiery Doge , passionate but not jealous , a noble turned democrat pro hac vice , an old man \u201c greatly \u201d finding \u201c quarrel in a straw , \u201d afforded a theme historically time-honoured , and yet unappropriated by tragic art . There was , too , a living interest in the story . For history was repeating itself , and \u201c politics were savage and uncertain . \u201d \u201c Mischief was afoot , \u201d and the tradition of a conspiracy which failed might find an historic parallel in a conspiracy which would succeed . There was \u201c that brewing in Italy \u201d which might , perhaps , inspire \u201c a people to redress itself , \u201d \u201c and with a cry of , \u2018 Up with the Republic ! \u2019 \u2018 Down with the Nobility ! \u2019 send the Barbarians of all nations back to their own dens ! \u201dIn taking the field as a dramatist , Byron sought to win distinction for himself \u2014 in the first place by historical accuracy , and , secondly , by artistic regularity \u2014 by a stricter attention to the dramatic \u201c unities . \u201d \u201c History is closely followed , \u201d he tells Murray , in a letter dated July 17 , 1820 ; and , again , in the Preface, which is an expansion of the letter , he gives a list of the authorities which he had consulted , and claims to have \u201c transferred into our language an historical fact worthy of commemoration . \u201d More than once in his letters to Murray he reverts to this profession of accuracy , and encloses some additional note , in which he points out and rectifies an occasional deviation from the historical record . In this respect , at any rate , he could contend on more than equal terms \u201c with established writers , \u201d that is , with Shakespeare and Otway , and could present to his countrymen an exacter and , so , more lifelike picture of the Venetian Republic . It is plain , too , that he was bitten with the love of study for its own sake , with a premature passion for erudition , and that he sought and found relief from physical and intellectual excitement in the intricacies of research . If his history is at fault , it was not from any lack of diligence on his part , but because the materials at his disposal or within his cognizance were inaccurate and misleading . He makes no mention of the huge collection of Venetian archives which had recently been deposited in the Convent of the Frari , or of Doria 's transcript of Sanudo 's Diaries , bequeathed in 1816 to the Library of St. Mark ; but he quotes as his authorities the Vit\u00e6 Ducum Venetorum , of Marin Sanudo, the Storia , etc ., of Andrea Navagero, and the Principj di Storia , etc ., of Vettor Sandi , which belongs to the latter half of the eighteenth century . Byron 's chroniclers were ancient , but not ancient enough ; and , though they \u201c handed down the story \u201d, they depart in numerous particulars from the facts recorded in contemporary documents . Unquestionably the legend , as it appears in Sanudo 's perplexing and uncritical narrative, is more dramatic than the \u201c low beginnings \u201d of the myth , which may be traced to the annalists of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries ; but , like other legends , it is insusceptible of proof . Byron 's Doge is almost , if not quite , as unhistorical as his Bonivard or his Mazeppa .At the close of the Preface , by way of an afterthought , Byron announces his determination to escape \u201c the reproach of the English theatrical compositions \u201d \u201c by preserving a nearer approach to unity , \u201d by substituting the regularity of French and Italian models for the barbarities of the Elizabethan dramatists and their successors . Goetheis said to have \u201c laughed to think that Byron , who , in practical life , could never adapt himself , and never even asked about a law , finally subjected himself to the stupidest of laws \u2014 that of the three unities . \u201d It was , perhaps , in part with this object in view , to make his readers smile , to provoke their astonishment , that he affected a severity foreign to his genius and at variance with his record . It was an agreeable thought that he could so easily pass from one extreme to another , from Manfred to Marino Faliero , and , at the same time , indulge \u201c in a little sally of gratuitous sauciness \u201dat the expense of his own countrymen . But there were other influences at work . He had been powerfully impressed by the energy and directness of Alfieri 's work , and he was eager to emulate the gravity and simplicity , if not the terseness and conciseness , of his style and language . The drama was a new world to conquer , and so far as \u201c his own literature \u201d was concerned it appeared that success might be attainable by \u201c a severer approach to the rules \u201d\u2014 that by taking Alfieri as his model he might step into the first rank of English dramatists . Goethe thought that Byron failed \u201c to understand the purpose \u201d of the \u201c three unities , \u201d that he regarded the law as an end in itself , and did not perceive that if a play was comprehensible the unities might be neglected and disregarded . It is possible that his \u201c blind obedience to the law \u201d may have been dictated by the fervour of a convert ; but it is equally possible that he looked beyond the law or its fulfilment to an ulterior object , the discomfiture of the romantic school , with its contempt for regularity , its passionate appeal from art to nature . If he was minded to raise a \u201c Grecian temple of the purest architecture \u201d, it was not without some thought and hope of shaming , by force of contrast , the \u201c mosque , \u201d the \u201c grotesque edifice \u201d of barbarian contemporaries and rivals . Byron was \u201c ever a fighter , \u201d and his claim to regularity , to a closer preservation of the \u201c unities , \u201d was of the nature of a challenge . Marino Faliero was dedicated to \u201c Baron Goethe , \u201d but the letter which should have contained the dedication was delayed in transit . Goethe never saw the dedication till it was placed in his hands by John Murray the Third , in 1831 , but he read the play , and after Byron 's death bore testimony to its peculiar characteristics and essential worth . \u201c Lord Byron , notwithstanding his predominant personality , has sometimes had the power of renouncing himself altogether , as may be seen in some of his dramatic pieces , particularly in his Marino Faliero . In this piece one quite forgets that Lord Byron , or even an Englishman , wrote it . We live entirely in Venice , and entirely in the time in which the action takes place . The personages speak quite from themselves and their own condition , without having any of the subjective feelings , thoughts , and opinions of the poet \u201dByron spent three months over the composition of Marino Faliero . The tragedy was completed July 17, and the copyinga month laterThe final draft of \u201c all the acts corrected \u201d was despatched to England some days before October 6 , 1820 . Early in January , 1821, an announcement reached Byron that his play was to be brought out at Drury Lane Theatre , by Elliston . Against this he protested by every means in his power , and finally , on Wednesday , April 25 , four days after the publication of the first edition, an injunction was obtained from Lord Chancellor Eldon , prohibiting a performance announced for that evening . Elliston pursued the Chancellor to the steps of his own house , and at the last moment persuaded him to allow the play to be acted on that night only . Legal proceeedings were taken , but , in the end , the injunction was withdrawn , with the consent of Byron 's solicitors , and the play was represented again on April 30 , and on five nights in the following May . As Byron had foreseen , Marino Faliero was coldly received by the playgoing public , and proved a loss to the \u201c speculating buffoons , \u201d who had not realized that it was \u201c unfit for their Fair or their booth \u201dByron was the first to perceive that the story of Marino Faliero was a drama \u201c ready to hand ; \u201d but he has had many followers , if not imitators or rivals . \u201c Marino Faliero , trag\u00e9die en cinq actes , \u201d by Casimir Jean Fran\u00e7ois Delavigne , was played for the first time at the Theatre of Porte Saint Martin , May 31 , 1829 . In Germany tragedies based on the same theme have been published by Otto Ludwig , Leipzig , 1874 ; Martin Grief , Vienna , 1879 ; Murad Effendi, 1881 , and othersMarino Faliero , a Tragedy , by A. C. Swinburne , was published in 1885 .

The conspiracy of the Doge Marino Faliero is one of the most remarkable events in the annals of the most singular government , city , and people of modern history . It occurred in the year 1355 . Every thing about Venice is , or was , extraordinary \u2014 her aspect is like a dream , and her history is like a romance . The story of this Doge is to be found in all her Chronicles , and particularly detailed in the \u201c Lives of the Doges , \u201d by Marin Sanuto , which is given in the Appendix . It is simply and clearly related , and is perhaps more dramatic in itself than any scenes which can be founded upon the subject . Marino Faliero appears to have been a man of talents and of courage . I find him commander-in-chief of the land forces at the siege of Zara ,where he beat the King of Hungary and his army of eighty thousand men , killing eight thousand men , and keeping the besieged at the same time in check ; an exploit to which I know none similar in history , except that of C\u00e6sar at Alesia ,and of Prince Eugene at Belgrade . He was afterwards commander of the fleet in the same war . He took Capo d'Istria . He was ambassador at Genoa and Rome ,\u2014 at which last he received the news of his election to the dukedom ; his absence being a proof that he sought it by no intrigue , since he was apprised of his predecessor 's death and his own succession at the same moment . But he appears to have been of an ungovernable temper . A story is told by Sanuto , of his having , many years before , when podesta and captain at Treviso , boxed the ears of the bishop , who was somewhat tardy in bringing the Host .For this , honest Sanuto \u201c saddles him with a judgment , \u201d as Thwackum did Square ;but he does not tell us whether he was punished or rebuked by the Senate for this outrage at the time of its commission . He seems , indeed , to have been afterwards at peace with the church , for we find him ambassador at Rome , and invested with the fief of Val di Marino , in the march of Treviso , and with the title of count , by Lorenzo , Count-bishop of Ceneda . For these facts my authorities are Sanuto , Vettor Sandi ,Andrea Navagero ,and the account of the siege of Zara , first published by the indefatigable Abate Morelli , in his Monumenti Veneziani di varia Letteratura , printed in 1796 ,all of which I have looked over in the original language . The moderns , Dar\u00f9 , Sismondi , and Laugier , nearly agree with the ancient chroniclers . Sismondi attributes the conspiracy to his jealousy ; but I find this nowhere asserted by the national historians . Vettor Sandi , indeed , says that \u201c Altri scrissero che .... dalla gelosa suspizion di esso Doge siasi fattostaccar con violenza , \u201d etc ., etc . ; but this appears to have been by no means the general opinion , nor is it alluded to by Sanuto , or by Navagero ; and Sandi himself adds , a moment after , that \u201c per altre Veneziane memorie traspiri , che non il solo desiderio di vendetta lo dispose alla congiura ma anche la innata abituale ambizion sua , per cui aneleva a farsi principe independente . \u201d The first motive appears to have been excited by the gross affront of the words written by Michel Steno on the ducal chair , and by the light and inadequate sentence of the Forty on the offender , who was one of their \u201c tre Capi . \u201dThe attentions of Steno himself appear to have been directed towards one of her damsels , and not to the \u201c Dogaressa \u201dherself , against whose fame not the slightest insinuation appears , while she is praised for her beauty , and remarked for her youth . Neither do I find it assertedthat the Doge was actuated by jealousy of his wife ; but rather by respect for her , and for his own honour , warranted by his past services and present dignity . I know not that the historical facts are alluded to in English , unless by Dr. Moore in his View of ItalyHis account is false and flippant , full of stale jests about old men and young wives , and wondering at so great an effect from so slight a cause . How so acute and severe an observer of mankind as the author of Zeluco could wonder at this is inconceivable . He knew that a basin of water spilt on Mrs. Masham 's gown deprived the Duke of Marlborough of his command , and led to the inglorious peace of Utrecht \u2014 that Louis XIV . was plunged into the most desolating wars , because his minister was nettled at his finding fault with a window , and wished to give him another occupation \u2014 that Helen lost Troy \u2014 that Lucretia expelled the Tarquins from Rome \u2014 and that Cava brought the Moors to Spain \u2014 that an insulted husband led the Gauls to Clusium , and thence to Rome \u2014 that a single verse of Frederick II .of Prussia on the Abb\u00e9 de Bernis , and a jest on Madame de Pompadour , led to the battle of Rosbach \u2014 that the elopement of Dearbhorgilwith Mac Murchad conducted the English to the slavery of Ireland that a personal pique between Maria Antoinette and the Duke of Orleans precipitated the first expulsion of the Bourbons \u2014 and , not to multiply instances of the teterrima causa , that Commodus , Domitian , and Caligula fell victims not to their public tyranny , but to private vengeance \u2014 and that an order to make Cromwell disembark from the ship in which he would have sailed to America destroyed both King and Commonwealth . After these instances , on the least reflection it is indeed extraordinary in Dr. Moore to seem surprised that a man used to command , who had served and swayed in the most important offices , should fiercely resent , in a fierce age , an unpunished affront , the grossest that can be offered to a man , be he prince or peasant . The age of Faliero is little to the purpose , unless to favour it \u2014 \u201c The young man 's wrath is likestraw on fire , But like red hot steel is the old man 's ire . \u201d\u201c Young men soon give and soon forget affronts , Old age is slow at both . \u201d Laugier 's reflections are more philosophical :\u2014 \u201c Tale f\u00f9 il fine ignominioso di un \u2019 uomo , che la sua nascit\u00e0 , la sua et\u00e0 , il suo carattere dovevano tener lontano dalle passioni produttrici di grandi delitti . I suoi talenti per lungo tempo esercitati ne \u2019 maggiori impieghi , la sua capacit\u00e0 sperimentata ne \u2019 governi e nelle ambasciate , gli avevano acquistato la stima e la fiducia de \u2019 cittadini , ed avevano uniti i suffragj per collocarlo alla testa della repubblica . Innalzato ad un grado che terminava gloriosamente la sua vita , il risentimento di un \u2019 ingiuria leggiera insinu\u00f2 nel suo cuore tal veleno che bast\u00f2 a corrompere le antiche sue qualit\u00e0 , e a condurlo al termine dei scellerati ; serio esempio , che prova non esservi et\u00e0 , in cui la prudenza umana sia sicura , e che nell \u2019 uomo restano sempre passioni capaci a disonorarlo , quando non invigili sopra se stesso . \u201dWhere did Dr. Moore find that Marino Faliero begged his life ? I have searched the chroniclers , and find nothing of the kind : it is true that he avowed all . He was conducted to the place of torture , but there is no mention made of any application for mercy on his part ; and the very circumstance of their having taken him to the rack seems to argue any thing but his having shown a want of firmness , which would doubtless have been also mentioned by those minute historians , who by no means favour him : such , indeed , would be contrary to his character as a soldier , to the age in which he lived , and at which he died , as it is to the truth of history . I know no justification , at any distance of time , for calumniating an historical character : surely truth belongs to the dead , and to the unfortunate : and they who have died upon a scaffold have generally had faults enough of their own , without attributing to them that which the very incurring of the perils which conducted them to their violent death renders , of all others , the most improbable . The black veil which is painted over the place of Marino Faliero amongst the Doges , and the Giants \u2019 Staircase, where he was crowned , and discrowned , and decapitated , struck forcibly upon my imagination ; as did his fiery character and strange story . I went , in 1819 , in search of his tomb more than once to the church San Giovanni e San Paolo ; and , as I was standing before the monument of another family , a priest came up to me and said , \u201c I can show you finer monuments than that . \u201d I told him that I was in search of that of the Faliero family , and particularly of the Doge Marino 's . \u201c Oh , \u201d said he , \u201c I will show it you ; \u201d and , conducting me to the outside , pointed out a sarcophagus in the wall with an illegible inscriptionHe said that it had been in a convent adjoining , but was removed after the French came , and placed in its present situation ; that he had seen the tomb opened at its removal ; there were still some bones remaining , but no positive vestige of the decapitation . The equestrian statueof which I have made mention in the third act as before that church is not , however , of a Faliero , but of some other now obsolete warrior , although of a later date . There were two other Doges of this family prior to Marino ; Ordelafo , who fell in battle at Zara , in 1117, and Vital Faliero , who reigned in 1082 . The family , originally from Fano , was of the most illustrious in blood and wealth in the city of once the most wealthy and still the most ancient families in Europe . The length I have gone into on this subject will show the interest I have taken in it . Whether I have succeeded or not in the tragedy , I have at least transferred into our language an historical fact worthy of commemoration . It is now four years that I have meditated this work ; and before I had sufficiently examined the records , I was rather disposed to have made it turn on a jealousy in Faliero . But , perceiving no foundation for this in historical truth , and aware that jealousy is an exhausted passion in the drama , I have given it a more historical form . I was , besides , well advised by the late Matthew Lewison that point , in talking with him of my intention at Venice in 1817 . \u201c If you make him jealous , \u201d said he , \u201c recollect that you have to contend with established writers , to say nothing of Shakespeare , and an exhausted subject :\u2014 stick to the old fiery Doge 's natural character , which will bear you out , if properly drawn ; and make your plot as regular as you can . \u201d Sir William Drummondgave me nearly the same counsel . How far I have followed these instructions , or whether they have availed me , is not for me to decide . I have had no view to the stage ; in its present state it is , perhaps , not a very exalted object of ambition ; besides , I have been too much behind the scenes to have thought it so at any time .And I cannot conceive any man of irritable feelingputting himself at the mercies of an audience . The sneering reader , and the loud critic , and the tart review , are scattered and distant calamities ; but the trampling of an intelligent or of an ignorant audience on a production which , be it good or bad , has been a mental labour to the writer , is a palpable and immediate grievance , heightened by a man 's doubt of their competency to judge , and his certainty of his own imprudence in electing them his judges . Were I capable of writing a play which could be deemed stage-worthy , success would give me no pleasure , and failure great pain . It is for this reason that , even during the time of being one of the committee of one of the theatres , I never made the attempt , and never willBut I wish that others would , for surely there is dramatic power somewhere , where Joanna Baillie , and Milman , and John Wilson exist . The City of the Plagueand the Fall of Jerusalemare full of the best \u201c mat\u00e9riel \u201d for tragedy that has been seen since Horace Walpole , except passages of Ethwaldand De MontfortIt is the fashion to underrate Horace Walpole ; firstly , because he was a nobleman , and secondly , because he was a gentleman ; but , to say nothing of the composition of his incomparable letters , and of the Castle of Otranto, he is the \u201c Ultimus Romanorum , \u201d the author of the Mysterious Mother, a tragedy of the highest order , and not a puling love-play . He is the father of the first romance and of the last tragedy in our language , and surely worthy of a higher place than any living writer , be he who he may .In speaking of the drama of Marino Faliero , I forgot to mention that the desire of preserving , though still too remote , a nearer approach to unity than the irregularity , which is the reproach of the English theatrical compositions , permits , has induced me to represent the conspiracy as already formed , and the Doge acceding to it ; whereas , in fact , it was of his own preparation and that of Israel Bertuccio . The other characters, incidents , and almost the time , which was wonderfully short for such a design in real life , are strictly historical , except that all the consultations took place in the palace . Had I followed this , the unity would have been better preserved ; but I wished to produce the Doge in the full assembly of the conspirators , instead of monotonously placing him always in dialogue with the same individuals .

S. Romaninand R. Sengertake the same view . On the other hand , Miss A. Wielpoints out that , according to the Dolfin Cronaca , which Berlan did not consult , Jacopo was in a \u201c mutilated \u201d condition when the trial was over , and he was permitted to take a last farewell of his wife and children in Torricella .

He had been despatched by the X. to Legnano , to investigate the conduct of Andrea Donate , the Doge 's brother-in-law , who was suspected of having embezzled the public moneys . His report was unfavourable to Donato , and , shortly after , he too fell sick and died . It is most improbable that the Doge was directly or indirectly responsible for the death of either brother ; but there was an hereditary feud , and the libellous epitaph was a move in the game . ]{ 124 }4 \u2014\u2014 checked by nought The vessel that creaks \u2014\u2014.\u2014{ 125 } \u2014\u2014 much pity .\u2014{ 126 } In this brief colloquy , and must redeem it .\u2014\u201c And I have loved thee , Ocean ! and my joy Of youthful sports was on thy breast to be Borne , like thy bubbles , onward : from a boy I wantoned with thy breakers . \u201d Childe Harold , Canto IV . stanza clxxxiv . lines 1-4 , Poetical Works , 1899 , ii . 461 , note 2 . ]{ 127 }I see your colour comes .\u2014{ 130 }\u2014 \u2018 A daughter of the house that now among Its ancestors in monumental brass Numbers eight Doges . \u2019 On the occasion of her marriage the Bucentaur came out in its splendour ; and a bridge of boats was thrown across the Canal Grande for the bridegroom and his retinue of three hundred horse . \u201d \u2014 Foscari , by Samuel Rogers , Poems , 1852 , ii . 93 , note .

INTRODUCTION TO CAIN . Cain was begun at Ravenna , July 16 , and finished September 9 , 1821Six months before , when he was at work on the first act of Sardanapalus , Byron had \u201c pondered \u201d Cain , but it was not till Sardanapalus and a second historical play , The Two Foscari , had been written , copied out , and sent to England , that he indulged his genius with a third drama \u2014 on \u201c a metaphysical subject , something in the style of Manfred \u201dGoethe 's comment on reading and reviewing Cain was that he should be surprised if Byron did not pursue the treatment of such \u201c biblical subjects , \u201d as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah; and , many years after , he told Crabb Robinsonthat Byron should have lived \u201c to execute his vocation ... to dramatize the Old Testament . \u201d He was better equipped for such a task than might have been imagined . A Scottish schoolboy , \u201c from a child he had known the Scriptures , \u201d and , as his Hebrew Melodies testify , he was not unwilling to turn to the Bible as a source of poetic inspiration . Moreover , he was born with the religious temperament . Questions \u201c of Providence , foreknowledge , will and fate , \u201d exercised his curiosity because they appealed to his imagination and moved his spirit . He was eager to plunge into controversy with friends and advisers who challenged or rebuked him , Hodgson , for instance , or Dallas ; and he responded with remarkable amenity to the strictures and exhortations of such orthodox professors as Mr. Sheppard and Dr. Kennedy . He was , no doubt , from first to last a heretic , impatient , not to say contemptuous , of authority , but he was by no means indifferent to religion altogether . To \u201c argue about it and about \u201d was a necessity , if not an agreeable relief , to his intellectual energies . It would appear from the Ravenna diary, that the conception of Lucifer was working in his brain before the \u201c tragedy of Cain \u201d was actually begun . He had been recording a \u201c thought \u201d which had come to him , that \u201c at the very height of human desire and pleasure , a certain sense of doubt and sorrow \u201d \u2014 an amari aliquid which links the future to the past , and so blots out the present \u2014 \u201c mingles with our bliss , \u201d making it of none effect , and , by way of moral or corollary to his soliloquy , he adds three lines of verse headed , \u201c Thought for a speech of Lucifer in the Tragedy of Cain \u201d \u2014 \u201c Were Death an Evil , would I let thee live ? Fool ! live as I live \u2014 as thy father lives , And thy son 's sons shall live for evermore . \u201d In these three lines , which were not inserted in the play , and in the preceding \u201c thought , \u201d we have the key-note to Cain . \u201c Man walketh in a vain shadow \u201d \u2014 a shadow which he can never overtake , the shadow of an eternally postponed fruition . With a being capable of infinite satisfaction , he is doomed to realize failure in attainment . In all that is best and most enjoyable , \u201c the rapturous moment and the placid hour , \u201d there is a foretaste of \u201c Death the Unknown \u201d ! The tragedy of Manfred lies in remorse for the inevitable past ; the tragedy of Cain , in revolt against the limitations of the inexorable present . The investigation of the \u201c sources \u201d of Cain does not lead to any very definite conclusionHe was pleased to call his play \u201c a Mystery , \u201d and , in his Preface, Byron alludes to the Old Mysteries as \u201c those very profane productions , whether in English , French , Italian , or Spanish . \u201d The first reprint of the Chester Plays was published by the Roxburghe Club in 1818 , but Byron 's knowledge of Mystery Plays was probably derived from Dodsley 's Plays, or from John Stevens 's Continuation of Dugdale 's Monasticon, or possibly , as Herr Schaffner suggests , from Warton 's History of English Poetry , ed . 1871 , ii . 222-230 . He may , too , have witnessed some belated Rappresentazione of the Creation and Fall at Ravenna , or in one of the remoter towns or villages of Italy . There is a superficial resemblance between the treatment of the actual encounter of Cain and Abel , and the conventional rendering of the same incident in the Ludus Coventri\u00e6 , and in the Mist\u00e8re du Viel Testament ; but it is unlikely that he had closely studied any one Mystery Play at first hand . On the other hand , his recollections of Gessner 's Death of Abel which \u201c he had never read since he was eight years old , \u201d were clearer than he imagined . Not only in such minor matters as the destruction of Cain 's altar by a whirlwind , and the substitution of the Angel of the Lord for the Deus of the Mysteries , but in the Teutonic domesticities of Cain and Adah , and the evangelical piety of Adam and Abel , there is a reflection , if not an imitation , of the German idyllOf his indebtedness to Milton he makes no formal acknowledgment , but he was not ashamed to shelter himself behind Milton 's shield when he was attacked on the score of blasphemy and profanity . \u201c If Cain be blasphemous , Paradise Lost is blasphemous \u201d, was , he would fain believe , a conclusive answer to his accusers . But apart from verbal parallels or coincidences , there is a genuine affinity between Byron 's Lucifer and Milton 's Satan . Lucifer , like Satan , is \u201c not less than Archangel ruined , \u201d a repulsed but \u201c unvanquished Titan , \u201d marred by a demonic sorrow , a confessor though a rival of Omnipotence . He is a majestic and , as a rule , a serious and solemn spirit , who compels the admiration and possibly the sympathy of the reader . There is , however , another strain in his ghostly attributes , which betrays a more recent consanguinity : now and again he gives token that he is of the lineage of Mephistopheles . He is sometimes , though rarely , a mocking as well as a rebellious spirit , and occasionally indulges in a grim persiflage beneath the dignity if not the capacity of Satan . It is needless to add that Lucifer has a most lifelike personality of his own . The conception of the spirit of evil justifying an eternal antagonism to the Creator from the standpoint of a superior morality , may , perhaps , be traced to a Manichean source , but it has been touched with a new emotion . Milton 's devil is an abstraction of infernal pride \u2014 \u201c Sole Positive of Night ! Antipathist of Light ! Fate 's only essence ! primal scorpion rod \u2014 The one permitted opposite of God ! \u201d Goethe 's devil is an abstraction of scorn . He \u201c maketh a mock \u201d alike of good and evil ! But Byron 's devil is a spirit , yet a mortal too \u2014 the traducer , because he has suffered for his sins ; the deceiver , because he is self-deceived ; the hoper against hope that there is a ransom for the soul in perfect self-will and not in perfect self-sacrifice . Byron did not uphold Lucifer , but he \u201c had passed that way , \u201d and could imagine a spiritual warfare not only against the Deus of the Mysteries or of the Book of Genesis , but against what he believed and acknowledged to be the Author and Principle of good . Autres temps , autres m\u0153urs ! It is all but impossible for the modern reader to appreciate the audacity of Cain , or to realize the alarm and indignation which it aroused by its appearance . Byron knew that he was raising a tempest , and pleads , in his Preface , \u201c that with regard to the language of Lucifer , it was difficult for me to make him talk like a clergyman , \u201d and again and again he assures his correspondentsthat it is Lucifer and not Byron who puts such awkward questions with regard to the \u201c politics of paradise \u201d and the origin of evil . Nobody seems to have believed him . It was taken for granted that Lucifer was the mouthpiece of Byron , that the author of Don Juan was not \u201c on the side of the angels . \u201d Little need be said of the \u201c literature , \u201d the pamphlets and poems which were evoked by the publication of Cain : A Mystery . One of the most prominent assailants, Archdeacon of Cleveland , 1832 , author inter alia of Original Sin , Free Will , etc ., 1818 ) issued A Remonstrance to Mr. John Murray , respecting a Recent Publication , 1822 , signed \u201c Oxoniensis . \u201d The sting of the Remonstrance lay in the exposure of the fact that Byron was indebted to Bayle 's Dictionary for his rabbinical legends , and that he had derived from the same source his Manichean doctrines of the Two Principles , etc ., and other \u201c often-refuted sophisms \u201d with regard to the origin of evil . Byron does not borrow more than a poet and a gentleman is at liberty to acquire by way of raw material , but it cannot be denied that he had read and inwardly digested more than one of Bayle 's \u201c most objectionable articles \u201dThe Remonstrance was answered in A Letter to Sir Walter Scott , etc ., by \u201c Harroviensis . \u201d Byron welcomed such a \u201c Defender of the Faith , \u201d and was anxious that Murray should print the letter together with the poem . But Murray belittled the \u201c defender , \u201d and was upbraided in turn for his slowness of heartFresh combatants rushed into the fray : \u201c Philo-Milton , \u201d with a Vindication of the \u201c Paradise Lost \u201d from the charge of exculpating \u201c Cain : A Mystery , \u201d London , 1822 ; \u201c Britannicus , \u201d with a pamphlet entitled , Revolutionary Causes , etc ., and A Postscript containing Strictures on \u201c Cain , \u201d etc ., London , 1822 , etc . ; but their works , which hardly deserve to be catalogued , have perished with them . Finally , in 1830 , a barrister named Harding Grant , author of Chancery Practice , compiled a workof more than four hundred pages , in which he treats \u201c the proceedings and speeches of Lucifer with the same earnestness as if they were existing and earthly personages . \u201d But it was \u201c a week too late . \u201d The \u201c Coryph\u00e6us of the Satanic School \u201d had passed away , and the tumult had \u201c dwindled to a calm . \u201d Cain \u201c appeared in conjunction with \u201d Sardanapalus and The Two Foscari , December 19 , 1821 . Last but not least of the three plays , it had been announced \u201c by a separate advertisement, for the purpose of exciting the greater curiosity \u201d, 1822 , p. 383 ) , and it was no sooner published than it was pirated . In the following January , \u201c Cain : A Mystery , by the author of Don Juan , \u201d was issued by W. Benbow , at Castle Street , Leicester SquareMurray had paid Byron \u00a3 2710 for the three tragedies , and in order to protect the copyright , he applied , through counsel, for an injunction in Chancery to stop the sale of piratical editions of Cain . In delivering judgment, the Chancellor , Lord Eldon, replying to Shadwell , drew a comparison between Cain and Paradise Lost , \u201c which he had read from beginning to end during the course of the last Long Vacation \u2014 solicit\u00e6 jucunda oblivia vit\u00e6 . \u201d No one , he argued , could deny that the object and effects of Paradise Lost were \u201c not to bring into disrepute , \u201d but \u201c to promote reverence for our religion , \u201d and , per contra , no one could affirm that it was impossible to arrive at an opposite conclusion with regard to \u201c the Preface , the poem , the general tone and manner of Cain . \u201d It was a question for a jury . A jury might decide that Cain was blasphemous , and void of copyright ; and as there was a reasonable doubt in his mind as to the character of the book , and a doubt as to the conclusion at which a jury would arrive , he was compelled to refuse the injunction . According to Dr . Smiles, the decision of a jury was taken , and an injunction eventually granted . If so , it was ineffectual , for Benbow issued another edition of Cain in 1824See , too , the case of Murray v. Benbow and Another , as reported in the Examiner , February 17 , 1822 ; and cases of Wolcot v. Walker , Southey v. Sherwood , Murray v. Benbow , and Lawrence v. Smith\u201c Cain , \u201d said Moore, \u201c has made a sensation . \u201d Friends and champions , the press , the public \u201c turned up their thumbs . \u201d Gifford shook his head ; Hobhouse \u201c launched out into a most violent invective \u201d; Jeffrey , in the Edinburgh , was regretful and hortatory ; Heber , in the Quarterly , was fault-finding and contemptuous . The \u201c parsons preached at it from Kentish Town to Pisa \u201dEven \u201c the very highest authority in the land , \u201d his Majesty King George IV ., \u201c expressed his disapprobation of the blasphemy and licentiousness of Lord Byron 's writings \u201dByron himself was forced to admit that \u201c my Mont Saint Jean seems Cain \u201dThe many were unanimous in their verdict , but the higher court of the few reversed the judgment . Goethe said that \u201c Its beauty is such as we shall not see a second time in the world \u201d; Scott , in speaking of \u201c the very grand and tremendous drama of Cain , \u201d said that the author had \u201c matched Milton on his own ground \u201d; \u201c Cain , \u201d wrote Shelley to Gisborne, \u201c is apocalyptic ; it is a revelation never before communicated to man . \u201d Uncritical praise , as well as uncritical censure , belongs to the past ; but the play remains , a singular exercise of \u201c poetic energy , \u201d a confession , ex animo , of \u201c the burthen of the mystery , ... the heavy and the weary weight Of all this unintelligible world . \u201d For reviews of Cain : A Mystery , vide ante , \u201c Introduction to Sardanapalus , \u201d p. 5 ; see , too , Eclectic Review , May , 1822 , N.

TO SIR WALTER SCOTT , BART ., THIS MYSTERY OF CAIN IS INSCRIBED , BY HIS OBLIGED FRIEND AND FAITHFUL SERVANT , THE AUTHOR .PREFACE The following scenes are entitled \u201c A Mystery , \u201d in conformity with the ancient title annexed to dramas upon similar subjects , which were styled \u201c Mysteries , or Moralities . \u201dThe author has by no means taken the same liberties with his subject which were common formerly , as may be seen by any reader curious enough to refer to those very profane productions , whether in English , French , Italian , or Spanish . The author has endeavoured to preserve the language adapted to his characters ; and where it istaken from actual Scripture , he has made as little alteration , even of words , as the rhythm would permit . The reader will recollect that the book of Genesis does not state that Eve was tempted by a demon , but by \u201c the Serpent; \u201d and that only because he was \u201c the most subtil of all the beasts of the field . \u201d Whatever interpretation the Rabbins and the Fathers may have put upon this , I take the words as I find them , and reply , with Bishop Watsonupon similar occasions , when the Fathers were quoted to him as Moderator in the schools of Cambridge , \u201c Behold the Book ! \u201d \u2014 holding up the Scripture . It is to be recollected , that my present subject has nothing to do with the New Testament , to which no reference can be here made without anachronism .With the poems upon similar topics I have not been recently familiar . Since I was twenty I have never read Milton ; but I had read him so frequently before , that this may make little difference . Gesner 's \u201c Death of Abel \u201d I have never read since I was eight years of age , at Aberdeen . The general impression of my recollection is delight ; but of the contents I remember only that Cain 's wife was called Mahala , and Abel 's Thirza ; in the following pages I have called them \u201c Adah \u201d and \u201c Zillah , \u201d the earliest female names which occur in Genesis . They were those of Lamech 's wives : those of Cain and Abel are not called by their names . Whether , then , a coincidence of subject may have caused the same in expression , I know nothing , and care as little .am prepared to be accused of Manicheism ,or some other hard name ending in ism , which makes a formidable figure and awful sound in the eyes and ears of those who would be as much puzzled to explain the terms so bandied about , as the liberal and pious indulgers in such epithets . Against such I can defend myself , or , if necessary , I can attack in turn . \u201c Claw for claw , as Conan said to Satan and the deevil take the shortest nails \u201d] The reader will please to bear in mind, that there is no allusion to a future state in any of the books of Moses , nor indeed in the Old Testament . For a reason for this extraordinary omission he may consult Warburton 's \u201c Divine Legation ; \u201dwhether satisfactory or not , no better has yet been assigned . I have therefore supposed it new to Cain , without , I hope , any perversion of Holy Writ . With regard to the language of Lucifer , it was difficult for me to make him talk like a clergyman upon the same subjects ; but I have done what I could to restrain him within the bounds of spiritual politeness . If he disclaims having tempted Eve in the shape of the Serpent , it is only because the book of Genesis has not the most distant allusion to anything of the kind , but merely to the Serpent in his serpentine capacity .", "In his own portion of the palace , with", "No doubt : yet most men like to live their days out .", "Go to , you 're a child ,", "We have decided .", "Well , sir !", "I used no poison , bribed no subtle master", "As the first of his son 's last banishment , 20", "Of this \u201c the Ten \u201d said nothing .", "As much of ceremony as you will ,", "We have higher business for our own .

S. Romaninand R. Sengertake the same view . On the other hand , Miss A. Wielpoints out that , according to the Dolfin Cronaca , which Berlan did not consult , Jacopo was in a \u201c mutilated \u201d condition when the trial was over , and he was permitted to take a last farewell of his wife and children in Torricella . Goethedid not share Eckermann 's astonishment that Byron \u201c could dwell so long on this torturing subject . \u201d \u201c He was always a self-tormentor , and hence such subjects were his darling theme . \u201d ]{ 122 }quando tractatur de rebus tangentibus ad attinentes Domini Ducis . \u201d The fact that \u201c Nos Franciscus Foscari , \u201d etc ., stood at the commencement of the decree of exile may have given rise to the tradition that the Doge , like a Roman father , tried and condemned his son .]{ 123 }Not long afterwards Marco Loredano , the admiral 's brother , met with a somewhat similar fate . He had been despatched by the X. to Legnano , to investigate the conduct of Andrea Donate , the Doge 's brother-in-law , who was suspected of having embezzled the public moneys . His report was unfavourable to Donato , and , shortly after , he too fell sick and died . It is most improbable that the Doge was directly or indirectly responsible for the death of either brother ; but there was an hereditary feud , and the libellous epitaph was a move in the game . ]{ 124 }4 \u2014\u2014 checked by nought The vessel that creaks \u2014\u2014.\u2014{ 125 } \u2014\u2014 much pity .\u2014{ 126 } In this brief colloquy , and must redeem it .\u2014\u201c And I have loved thee , Ocean ! and my joy Of youthful sports was on thy breast to be Borne , like thy bubbles , onward : from a boy I wantoned with thy breakers . \u201d Childe Harold , Canto IV . stanza clxxxiv . lines 1-4 , Poetical Works , 1899 , ii . 461 , note 2 . ]{ 127 }I see your colour comes .\u2014{ 130 }\u2014 \u2018 A daughter of the house that now among Its ancestors in monumental brass Numbers eight Doges . \u2019 On the occasion of her marriage the Bucentaur came out in its splendour ; and a bridge of boats was thrown across the Canal Grande for the bridegroom and his retinue of three hundred horse . \u201d \u2014 Foscari , by Samuel Rogers , Poems , 1852 , ii . 93 , note .

INTRODUCTION TO CAIN . Cain was begun at Ravenna , July 16 , and finished September 9 , 1821Six months before , when he was at work on the first act of Sardanapalus , Byron had \u201c pondered \u201d Cain , but it was not till Sardanapalus and a second historical play , The Two Foscari , had been written , copied out , and sent to England , that he indulged his genius with a third drama \u2014 on \u201c a metaphysical subject , something in the style of Manfred \u201dGoethe 's comment on reading and reviewing Cain was that he should be surprised if Byron did not pursue the treatment of such \u201c biblical subjects , \u201d as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah; and , many years after , he told Crabb Robinsonthat Byron should have lived \u201c to execute his vocation ... to dramatize the Old Testament . \u201d He was better equipped for such a task than might have been imagined . A Scottish schoolboy , \u201c from a child he had known the Scriptures , \u201d and , as his Hebrew Melodies testify , he was not unwilling to turn to the Bible as a source of poetic inspiration . Moreover , he was born with the religious temperament . Questions \u201c of Providence , foreknowledge , will and fate , \u201d exercised his curiosity because they appealed to his imagination and moved his spirit . He was eager to plunge into controversy with friends and advisers who challenged or rebuked him , Hodgson , for instance , or Dallas ; and he responded with remarkable amenity to the strictures and exhortations of such orthodox professors as Mr. Sheppard and Dr. Kennedy . He was , no doubt , from first to last a heretic , impatient , not to say contemptuous , of authority , but he was by no means indifferent to religion altogether . To \u201c argue about it and about \u201d was a necessity , if not an agreeable relief , to his intellectual energies . It would appear from the Ravenna diary, that the conception of Lucifer was working in his brain before the \u201c tragedy of Cain \u201d was actually begun . He had been recording a \u201c thought \u201d which had come to him , that \u201c at the very height of human desire and pleasure , a certain sense of doubt and sorrow \u201d \u2014 an amari aliquid which links the future to the past , and so blots out the present \u2014 \u201c mingles with our bliss , \u201d making it of none effect , and , by way of moral or corollary to his soliloquy , he adds three lines of verse headed , \u201c Thought for a speech of Lucifer in the Tragedy of Cain \u201d \u2014 \u201c Were Death an Evil , would I let thee live ? Fool ! live as I live \u2014 as thy father lives , And thy son 's sons shall live for evermore . \u201d In these three lines , which were not inserted in the play , and in the preceding \u201c thought , \u201d we have the key-note to Cain . \u201c Man walketh in a vain shadow \u201d \u2014 a shadow which he can never overtake , the shadow of an eternally postponed fruition . With a being capable of infinite satisfaction , he is doomed to realize failure in attainment . In all that is best and most enjoyable , \u201c the rapturous moment and the placid hour , \u201d there is a foretaste of \u201c Death the Unknown \u201d ! The tragedy of Manfred lies in remorse for the inevitable past ; the tragedy of Cain , in revolt against the limitations of the inexorable present . The investigation of the \u201c sources \u201d of Cain does not lead to any very definite conclusionHe was pleased to call his play \u201c a Mystery , \u201d and , in his Preface, Byron alludes to the Old Mysteries as \u201c those very profane productions , whether in English , French , Italian , or Spanish . \u201d The first reprint of the Chester Plays was published by the Roxburghe Club in 1818 , but Byron 's knowledge of Mystery Plays was probably derived from Dodsley 's Plays, or from John Stevens 's Continuation of Dugdale 's Monasticon, or possibly , as Herr Schaffner suggests , from Warton 's History of English Poetry , ed . 1871 , ii . 222-230 . He may , too , have witnessed some belated Rappresentazione of the Creation and Fall at Ravenna , or in one of the remoter towns or villages of Italy . There is a superficial resemblance between the treatment of the actual encounter of Cain and Abel , and the conventional rendering of the same incident in the Ludus Coventri\u00e6 , and in the Mist\u00e8re du Viel Testament ; but it is unlikely that he had closely studied any one Mystery Play at first hand . On the other hand , his recollections of Gessner 's Death of Abel which \u201c he had never read since he was eight years old , \u201d were clearer than he imagined . Not only in such minor matters as the destruction of Cain 's altar by a whirlwind , and the substitution of the Angel of the Lord for the Deus of the Mysteries , but in the Teutonic domesticities of Cain and Adah , and the evangelical piety of Adam and Abel , there is a reflection , if not an imitation , of the German idyllOf his indebtedness to Milton he makes no formal acknowledgment , but he was not ashamed to shelter himself behind Milton 's shield when he was attacked on the score of blasphemy and profanity . \u201c If Cain be blasphemous , Paradise Lost is blasphemous \u201d, was , he would fain believe , a conclusive answer to his accusers . But apart from verbal parallels or coincidences , there is a genuine affinity between Byron 's Lucifer and Milton 's Satan . Lucifer , like Satan , is \u201c not less than Archangel ruined , \u201d a repulsed but \u201c unvanquished Titan , \u201d marred by a demonic sorrow , a confessor though a rival of Omnipotence . He is a majestic and , as a rule , a serious and solemn spirit , who compels the admiration and possibly the sympathy of the reader . There is , however , another strain in his ghostly attributes , which betrays a more recent consanguinity : now and again he gives token that he is of the lineage of Mephistopheles . He is sometimes , though rarely , a mocking as well as a rebellious spirit , and occasionally indulges in a grim persiflage beneath the dignity if not the capacity of Satan . It is needless to add that Lucifer has a most lifelike personality of his own . The conception of the spirit of evil justifying an eternal antagonism to the Creator from the standpoint of a superior morality , may , perhaps , be traced to a Manichean source , but it has been touched with a new emotion . Milton 's devil is an abstraction of infernal pride \u2014 \u201c Sole Positive of Night ! Antipathist of Light ! Fate 's only essence ! primal scorpion rod \u2014 The one permitted opposite of God ! \u201d Goethe 's devil is an abstraction of scorn . He \u201c maketh a mock \u201d alike of good and evil ! But Byron 's devil is a spirit , yet a mortal too \u2014 the traducer , because he has suffered for his sins ; the deceiver , because he is self-deceived ; the hoper against hope that there is a ransom for the soul in perfect self-will and not in perfect self-sacrifice . Byron did not uphold Lucifer , but he \u201c had passed that way , \u201d and could imagine a spiritual warfare not only against the Deus of the Mysteries or of the Book of Genesis , but against what he believed and acknowledged to be the Author and Principle of good . Autres temps , autres m\u0153urs ! It is all but impossible for the modern reader to appreciate the audacity of Cain , or to realize the alarm and indignation which it aroused by its appearance . Byron knew that he was raising a tempest , and pleads , in his Preface , \u201c that with regard to the language of Lucifer , it was difficult for me to make him talk like a clergyman , \u201d and again and again he assures his correspondentsthat it is Lucifer and not Byron who puts such awkward questions with regard to the \u201c politics of paradise \u201d and the origin of evil . Nobody seems to have believed him . It was taken for granted that Lucifer was the mouthpiece of Byron , that the author of Don Juan was not \u201c on the side of the angels . \u201d Little need be said of the \u201c literature , \u201d the pamphlets and poems which were evoked by the publication of Cain : A Mystery . One of the most prominent assailants, Archdeacon of Cleveland , 1832 , author inter alia of Original Sin , Free Will , etc ., 1818 ) issued A Remonstrance to Mr. John Murray , respecting a Recent Publication , 1822 , signed \u201c Oxoniensis . \u201d The sting of the Remonstrance lay in the exposure of the fact that Byron was indebted to Bayle 's Dictionary for his rabbinical legends , and that he had derived from the same source his Manichean doctrines of the Two Principles , etc ., and other \u201c often-refuted sophisms \u201d with regard to the origin of evil . Byron does not borrow more than a poet and a gentleman is at liberty to acquire by way of raw material , but it cannot be denied that he had read and inwardly digested more than one of Bayle 's \u201c most objectionable articles \u201dThe Remonstrance was answered in A Letter to Sir Walter Scott , etc ., by \u201c Harroviensis . \u201d Byron welcomed such a \u201c Defender of the Faith , \u201d and was anxious that Murray should print the letter together with the poem . But Murray belittled the \u201c defender , \u201d and was upbraided in turn for his slowness of heartFresh combatants rushed into the fray : \u201c Philo-Milton , \u201d with a Vindication of the \u201c Paradise Lost \u201d from the charge of exculpating \u201c Cain : A Mystery , \u201d London , 1822 ; \u201c Britannicus , \u201d with a pamphlet entitled , Revolutionary Causes , etc ., and A Postscript containing Strictures on \u201c Cain , \u201d etc ., London , 1822 , etc . ; but their works , which hardly deserve to be catalogued , have perished with them . Finally , in 1830 , a barrister named Harding Grant , author of Chancery Practice , compiled a workof more than four hundred pages , in which he treats \u201c the proceedings and speeches of Lucifer with the same earnestness as if they were existing and earthly personages . \u201d But it was \u201c a week too late . \u201d The \u201c Coryph\u00e6us of the Satanic School \u201d had passed away , and the tumult had \u201c dwindled to a calm . \u201d Cain \u201c appeared in conjunction with \u201d Sardanapalus and The Two Foscari , December 19 , 1821 . Last but not least of the three plays , it had been announced \u201c by a separate advertisement, for the purpose of exciting the greater curiosity \u201d, 1822 , p. 383 ) , and it was no sooner published than it was pirated . In the following January , \u201c Cain : A Mystery , by the author of Don Juan , \u201d was issued by W. Benbow , at Castle Street , Leicester SquareMurray had paid Byron \u00a3 2710 for the three tragedies , and in order to protect the copyright , he applied , through counsel, for an injunction in Chancery to stop the sale of piratical editions of Cain . In delivering judgment, the Chancellor , Lord Eldon, replying to Shadwell , drew a comparison between Cain and Paradise Lost , \u201c which he had read from beginning to end during the course of the last Long Vacation \u2014 solicit\u00e6 jucunda oblivia vit\u00e6 . \u201d No one , he argued , could deny that the object and effects of Paradise Lost were \u201c not to bring into disrepute , \u201d but \u201c to promote reverence for our religion , \u201d and , per contra , no one could affirm that it was impossible to arrive at an opposite conclusion with regard to \u201c the Preface , the poem , the general tone and manner of Cain . \u201d It was a question for a jury . A jury might decide that Cain was blasphemous , and void of copyright ; and as there was a reasonable doubt in his mind as to the character of the book , and a doubt as to the conclusion at which a jury would arrive , he was compelled to refuse the injunction . According to Dr . Smiles, the decision of a jury was taken , and an injunction eventually granted . If so , it was ineffectual , for Benbow issued another edition of Cain in 1824See , too , the case of Murray v. Benbow and Another , as reported in the Examiner , February 17 , 1822 ; and cases of Wolcot v. Walker , Southey v. Sherwood , Murray v. Benbow , and Lawrence v. Smith\u201c Cain , \u201d said Moore, \u201c has made a sensation . \u201d Friends and champions , the press , the public \u201c turned up their thumbs . \u201d Gifford shook his head ; Hobhouse \u201c launched out into a most violent invective \u201d; Jeffrey , in the Edinburgh , was regretful and hortatory ; Heber , in the Quarterly , was fault-finding and contemptuous . The \u201c parsons preached at it from Kentish Town to Pisa \u201dEven \u201c the very highest authority in the land , \u201d his Majesty King George IV ., \u201c expressed his disapprobation of the blasphemy and licentiousness of Lord Byron 's writings \u201dByron himself was forced to admit that \u201c my Mont Saint Jean seems Cain \u201dThe many were unanimous in their verdict , but the higher court of the few reversed the judgment . Goethe said that \u201c Its beauty is such as we shall not see a second time in the world \u201d; Scott , in speaking of \u201c the very grand and tremendous drama of Cain , \u201d said that the author had \u201c matched Milton on his own ground \u201d; \u201c Cain , \u201d wrote Shelley to Gisborne, \u201c is apocalyptic ; it is a revelation never before communicated to man . \u201d Uncritical praise , as well as uncritical censure , belongs to the past ; but the play remains , a singular exercise of \u201c poetic energy , \u201d a confession , ex animo , of \u201c the burthen of the mystery , ... the heavy and the weary weight Of all this unintelligible world . \u201d For reviews of Cain : A Mystery , vide ante , \u201c Introduction to Sardanapalus , \u201d p. 5 ; see , too , Eclectic Review , May , 1822 , N.

TO SIR WALTER SCOTT , BART ., THIS MYSTERY OF CAIN IS INSCRIBED , BY HIS OBLIGED FRIEND AND FAITHFUL SERVANT , THE AUTHOR .PREFACE The following scenes are entitled \u201c A Mystery , \u201d in conformity with the ancient title annexed to dramas upon similar subjects , which were styled \u201c Mysteries , or Moralities . \u201dThe author has by no means taken the same liberties with his subject which were common formerly , as may be seen by any reader curious enough to refer to those very profane productions , whether in English , French , Italian , or Spanish . The author has endeavoured to preserve the language adapted to his characters ; and where it istaken from actual Scripture , he has made as little alteration , even of words , as the rhythm would permit . The reader will recollect that the book of Genesis does not state that Eve was tempted by a demon , but by \u201c the Serpent; \u201d and that only because he was \u201c the most subtil of all the beasts of the field . \u201d Whatever interpretation the Rabbins and the Fathers may have put upon this , I take the words as I find them , and reply , with Bishop Watsonupon similar occasions , when the Fathers were quoted to him as Moderator in the schools of Cambridge , \u201c Behold the Book ! \u201d \u2014 holding up the Scripture . It is to be recollected , that my present subject has nothing to do with the New Testament , to which no reference can be here made without anachronism .With the poems upon similar topics I have not been recently familiar . Since I was twenty I have never read Milton ; but I had read him so frequently before , that this may make little difference . Gesner 's \u201c Death of Abel \u201d I have never read since I was eight years of age , at Aberdeen . The general impression of my recollection is delight ; but of the contents I remember only that Cain 's wife was called Mahala , and Abel 's Thirza ; in the following pages I have called them \u201c Adah \u201d and \u201c Zillah , \u201d the earliest female names which occur in Genesis . They were those of Lamech 's wives : those of Cain and Abel are not called by their names . Whether , then , a coincidence of subject may have caused the same in expression , I know nothing , and care as little .am prepared to be accused of Manicheism ,or some other hard name ending in ism , which makes a formidable figure and awful sound in the eyes and ears of those who would be as much puzzled to explain the terms so bandied about , as the liberal and pious indulgers in such epithets . Against such I can defend myself , or , if necessary , I can attack in turn . \u201c Claw for claw , as Conan said to Satan and the deevil take the shortest nails \u201d] The reader will please to bear in mind, that there is no allusion to a future state in any of the books of Moses , nor indeed in the Old Testament . For a reason for this extraordinary omission he may consult Warburton 's \u201c Divine Legation ; \u201dwhether satisfactory or not , no better has yet been assigned . I have therefore supposed it new to Cain , without , I hope , any perversion of Holy Writ . With regard to the language of Lucifer , it was difficult for me to make him talk like a clergyman upon the same subjects ; but I have done what I could to restrain him within the bounds of spiritual politeness . If he disclaims having tempted Eve in the shape of the Serpent , it is only because the book of Genesis has not the most distant allusion to anything of the kind , but merely to the Serpent in his serpentine capacity .", "\u201c The Ten \u201d in council .", "Shall be the last of the old Doge 's reign ,", "\u2018 Twas fit that some one of such different thoughts", "Her sex 's privilege .", "Forthwith \u2014 when this long leave is taken . \u2018 Tis", "\u2018 Twas so", "And I \u2014\u2014", "The presence of your husband 's Judges .", "I am sent hither to your husband , to", "All that 's essential \u2014 leave the rest to me .", "\u2018 Tis moderate \u2014 not even life for life , the rule", "And the old Doge , who knew him doomed , smiled on him 300", "Swerved .", "You must .", "I bear that of \u201c the Ten . \u201d", "It shows", "Decides to-day must not give way before", "From ours should be a witness , lest false tongues", "Its passage , but impedes it not \u2014 once passed .", "You , with your wonted scruples , teach us pause ,", "I have .", "Time to admonish them again .", "Doubtless .", "Retire , But leave the torch .", "Right ! 350", "Even so : when he ,", "Sorrow preys upon", "And present", "We 'll elect another ,", "You may .", "Fail to move them , and to remove him : since", "I have prepared such arguments as will not 50", "If not , \u2018 twill punish his hypocrisy .", "The torch , there !", "More seldom still .", "Well , sir !", "You know well 200", "ACT V .", "gave a crown", "His sons expire by natural deaths , and I", "If she so wills it .", "Lady ! words", "You forget , you cannot .", "They are , in all maternal things .", "The victims are not equal ; he has seen", "No less than age .", "Alone is aimed at .", "And my dead father .", "How !\u2014 my Giunta !", "Not I , now", "When I came here .

INTRODUCTION TO CAIN . Cain was begun at Ravenna , July 16 , and finished September 9 , 1821Six months before , when he was at work on the first act of Sardanapalus , Byron had \u201c pondered \u201d Cain , but it was not till Sardanapalus and a second historical play , The Two Foscari , had been written , copied out , and sent to England , that he indulged his genius with a third drama \u2014 on \u201c a metaphysical subject , something in the style of Manfred \u201dGoethe 's comment on reading and reviewing Cain was that he should be surprised if Byron did not pursue the treatment of such \u201c biblical subjects , \u201d as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah; and , many years after , he told Crabb Robinsonthat Byron should have lived \u201c to execute his vocation ... to dramatize the Old Testament . \u201d He was better equipped for such a task than might have been imagined . A Scottish schoolboy , \u201c from a child he had known the Scriptures , \u201d and , as his Hebrew Melodies testify , he was not unwilling to turn to the Bible as a source of poetic inspiration . Moreover , he was born with the religious temperament . Questions \u201c of Providence , foreknowledge , will and fate , \u201d exercised his curiosity because they appealed to his imagination and moved his spirit . He was eager to plunge into controversy with friends and advisers who challenged or rebuked him , Hodgson , for instance , or Dallas ; and he responded with remarkable amenity to the strictures and exhortations of such orthodox professors as Mr. Sheppard and Dr. Kennedy . He was , no doubt , from first to last a heretic , impatient , not to say contemptuous , of authority , but he was by no means indifferent to religion altogether . To \u201c argue about it and about \u201d was a necessity , if not an agreeable relief , to his intellectual energies . It would appear from the Ravenna diary, that the conception of Lucifer was working in his brain before the \u201c tragedy of Cain \u201d was actually begun . He had been recording a \u201c thought \u201d which had come to him , that \u201c at the very height of human desire and pleasure , a certain sense of doubt and sorrow \u201d \u2014 an amari aliquid which links the future to the past , and so blots out the present \u2014 \u201c mingles with our bliss , \u201d making it of none effect , and , by way of moral or corollary to his soliloquy , he adds three lines of verse headed , \u201c Thought for a speech of Lucifer in the Tragedy of Cain \u201d \u2014 \u201c Were Death an Evil , would I let thee live ? Fool ! live as I live \u2014 as thy father lives , And thy son 's sons shall live for evermore . \u201d In these three lines , which were not inserted in the play , and in the preceding \u201c thought , \u201d we have the key-note to Cain . \u201c Man walketh in a vain shadow \u201d \u2014 a shadow which he can never overtake , the shadow of an eternally postponed fruition . With a being capable of infinite satisfaction , he is doomed to realize failure in attainment . In all that is best and most enjoyable , \u201c the rapturous moment and the placid hour , \u201d there is a foretaste of \u201c Death the Unknown \u201d ! The tragedy of Manfred lies in remorse for the inevitable past ; the tragedy of Cain , in revolt against the limitations of the inexorable present . The investigation of the \u201c sources \u201d of Cain does not lead to any very definite conclusionHe was pleased to call his play \u201c a Mystery , \u201d and , in his Preface, Byron alludes to the Old Mysteries as \u201c those very profane productions , whether in English , French , Italian , or Spanish . \u201d The first reprint of the Chester Plays was published by the Roxburghe Club in 1818 , but Byron 's knowledge of Mystery Plays was probably derived from Dodsley 's Plays, or from John Stevens 's Continuation of Dugdale 's Monasticon, or possibly , as Herr Schaffner suggests , from Warton 's History of English Poetry , ed . 1871 , ii . 222-230 . He may , too , have witnessed some belated Rappresentazione of the Creation and Fall at Ravenna , or in one of the remoter towns or villages of Italy . There is a superficial resemblance between the treatment of the actual encounter of Cain and Abel , and the conventional rendering of the same incident in the Ludus Coventri\u00e6 , and in the Mist\u00e8re du Viel Testament ; but it is unlikely that he had closely studied any one Mystery Play at first hand . On the other hand , his recollections of Gessner 's Death of Abel which \u201c he had never read since he was eight years old , \u201d were clearer than he imagined . Not only in such minor matters as the destruction of Cain 's altar by a whirlwind , and the substitution of the Angel of the Lord for the Deus of the Mysteries , but in the Teutonic domesticities of Cain and Adah , and the evangelical piety of Adam and Abel , there is a reflection , if not an imitation , of the German idyllOf his indebtedness to Milton he makes no formal acknowledgment , but he was not ashamed to shelter himself behind Milton 's shield when he was attacked on the score of blasphemy and profanity . \u201c If Cain be blasphemous , Paradise Lost is blasphemous \u201d, was , he would fain believe , a conclusive answer to his accusers . But apart from verbal parallels or coincidences , there is a genuine affinity between Byron 's Lucifer and Milton 's Satan . Lucifer , like Satan , is \u201c not less than Archangel ruined , \u201d a repulsed but \u201c unvanquished Titan , \u201d marred by a demonic sorrow , a confessor though a rival of Omnipotence . He is a majestic and , as a rule , a serious and solemn spirit , who compels the admiration and possibly the sympathy of the reader . There is , however , another strain in his ghostly attributes , which betrays a more recent consanguinity : now and again he gives token that he is of the lineage of Mephistopheles . He is sometimes , though rarely , a mocking as well as a rebellious spirit , and occasionally indulges in a grim persiflage beneath the dignity if not the capacity of Satan . It is needless to add that Lucifer has a most lifelike personality of his own . The conception of the spirit of evil justifying an eternal antagonism to the Creator from the standpoint of a superior morality , may , perhaps , be traced to a Manichean source , but it has been touched with a new emotion . Milton 's devil is an abstraction of infernal pride \u2014 \u201c Sole Positive of Night ! Antipathist of Light ! Fate 's only essence ! primal scorpion rod \u2014 The one permitted opposite of God ! \u201d Goethe 's devil is an abstraction of scorn . He \u201c maketh a mock \u201d alike of good and evil ! But Byron 's devil is a spirit , yet a mortal too \u2014 the traducer , because he has suffered for his sins ; the deceiver , because he is self-deceived ; the hoper against hope that there is a ransom for the soul in perfect self-will and not in perfect self-sacrifice . Byron did not uphold Lucifer , but he \u201c had passed that way , \u201d and could imagine a spiritual warfare not only against the Deus of the Mysteries or of the Book of Genesis , but against what he believed and acknowledged to be the Author and Principle of good . Autres temps , autres m\u0153urs ! It is all but impossible for the modern reader to appreciate the audacity of Cain , or to realize the alarm and indignation which it aroused by its appearance . Byron knew that he was raising a tempest , and pleads , in his Preface , \u201c that with regard to the language of Lucifer , it was difficult for me to make him talk like a clergyman , \u201d and again and again he assures his correspondentsthat it is Lucifer and not Byron who puts such awkward questions with regard to the \u201c politics of paradise \u201d and the origin of evil . Nobody seems to have believed him . It was taken for granted that Lucifer was the mouthpiece of Byron , that the author of Don Juan was not \u201c on the side of the angels . \u201d Little need be said of the \u201c literature , \u201d the pamphlets and poems which were evoked by the publication of Cain : A Mystery . One of the most prominent assailants, Archdeacon of Cleveland , 1832 , author inter alia of Original Sin , Free Will , etc ., 1818 ) issued A Remonstrance to Mr. John Murray , respecting a Recent Publication , 1822 , signed \u201c Oxoniensis . \u201d The sting of the Remonstrance lay in the exposure of the fact that Byron was indebted to Bayle 's Dictionary for his rabbinical legends , and that he had derived from the same source his Manichean doctrines of the Two Principles , etc ., and other \u201c often-refuted sophisms \u201d with regard to the origin of evil . Byron does not borrow more than a poet and a gentleman is at liberty to acquire by way of raw material , but it cannot be denied that he had read and inwardly digested more than one of Bayle 's \u201c most objectionable articles \u201dThe Remonstrance was answered in A Letter to Sir Walter Scott , etc ., by \u201c Harroviensis . \u201d Byron welcomed such a \u201c Defender of the Faith , \u201d and was anxious that Murray should print the letter together with the poem . But Murray belittled the \u201c defender , \u201d and was upbraided in turn for his slowness of heartFresh combatants rushed into the fray : \u201c Philo-Milton , \u201d with a Vindication of the \u201c Paradise Lost \u201d from the charge of exculpating \u201c Cain : A Mystery , \u201d London , 1822 ; \u201c Britannicus , \u201d with a pamphlet entitled , Revolutionary Causes , etc ., and A Postscript containing Strictures on \u201c Cain , \u201d etc ., London , 1822 , etc . ; but their works , which hardly deserve to be catalogued , have perished with them . Finally , in 1830 , a barrister named Harding Grant , author of Chancery Practice , compiled a workof more than four hundred pages , in which he treats \u201c the proceedings and speeches of Lucifer with the same earnestness as if they were existing and earthly personages . \u201d But it was \u201c a week too late . \u201d The \u201c Coryph\u00e6us of the Satanic School \u201d had passed away , and the tumult had \u201c dwindled to a calm . \u201d Cain \u201c appeared in conjunction with \u201d Sardanapalus and The Two Foscari , December 19 , 1821 . Last but not least of the three plays , it had been announced \u201c by a separate advertisement, for the purpose of exciting the greater curiosity \u201d, 1822 , p. 383 ) , and it was no sooner published than it was pirated . In the following January , \u201c Cain : A Mystery , by the author of Don Juan , \u201d was issued by W. Benbow , at Castle Street , Leicester SquareMurray had paid Byron \u00a3 2710 for the three tragedies , and in order to protect the copyright , he applied , through counsel, for an injunction in Chancery to stop the sale of piratical editions of Cain . In delivering judgment, the Chancellor , Lord Eldon, replying to Shadwell , drew a comparison between Cain and Paradise Lost , \u201c which he had read from beginning to end during the course of the last Long Vacation \u2014 solicit\u00e6 jucunda oblivia vit\u00e6 . \u201d No one , he argued , could deny that the object and effects of Paradise Lost were \u201c not to bring into disrepute , \u201d but \u201c to promote reverence for our religion , \u201d and , per contra , no one could affirm that it was impossible to arrive at an opposite conclusion with regard to \u201c the Preface , the poem , the general tone and manner of Cain . \u201d It was a question for a jury . A jury might decide that Cain was blasphemous , and void of copyright ; and as there was a reasonable doubt in his mind as to the character of the book , and a doubt as to the conclusion at which a jury would arrive , he was compelled to refuse the injunction . According to Dr . Smiles, the decision of a jury was taken , and an injunction eventually granted . If so , it was ineffectual , for Benbow issued another edition of Cain in 1824See , too , the case of Murray v. Benbow and Another , as reported in the Examiner , February 17 , 1822 ; and cases of Wolcot v. Walker , Southey v. Sherwood , Murray v. Benbow , and Lawrence v. Smith\u201c Cain , \u201d said Moore, \u201c has made a sensation . \u201d Friends and champions , the press , the public \u201c turned up their thumbs . \u201d Gifford shook his head ; Hobhouse \u201c launched out into a most violent invective \u201d; Jeffrey , in the Edinburgh , was regretful and hortatory ; Heber , in the Quarterly , was fault-finding and contemptuous . The \u201c parsons preached at it from Kentish Town to Pisa \u201dEven \u201c the very highest authority in the land , \u201d his Majesty King George IV ., \u201c expressed his disapprobation of the blasphemy and licentiousness of Lord Byron 's writings \u201dByron himself was forced to admit that \u201c my Mont Saint Jean seems Cain \u201dThe many were unanimous in their verdict , but the higher court of the few reversed the judgment . Goethe said that \u201c Its beauty is such as we shall not see a second time in the world \u201d; Scott , in speaking of \u201c the very grand and tremendous drama of Cain , \u201d said that the author had \u201c matched Milton on his own ground \u201d; \u201c Cain , \u201d wrote Shelley to Gisborne, \u201c is apocalyptic ; it is a revelation never before communicated to man . \u201d Uncritical praise , as well as uncritical censure , belongs to the past ; but the play remains , a singular exercise of \u201c poetic energy , \u201d a confession , ex animo , of \u201c the burthen of the mystery , ... the heavy and the weary weight Of all this unintelligible world . \u201d For reviews of Cain : A Mystery , vide ante , \u201c Introduction to Sardanapalus , \u201d p. 5 ; see , too , Eclectic Review , May , 1822 , N.

TO SIR WALTER SCOTT , BART ., THIS MYSTERY OF CAIN IS INSCRIBED , BY HIS OBLIGED FRIEND AND FAITHFUL SERVANT , THE AUTHOR .PREFACE The following scenes are entitled \u201c A Mystery , \u201d in conformity with the ancient title annexed to dramas upon similar subjects , which were styled \u201c Mysteries , or Moralities . \u201dThe author has by no means taken the same liberties with his subject which were common formerly , as may be seen by any reader curious enough to refer to those very profane productions , whether in English , French , Italian , or Spanish . The author has endeavoured to preserve the language adapted to his characters ; and where it istaken from actual Scripture , he has made as little alteration , even of words , as the rhythm would permit . The reader will recollect that the book of Genesis does not state that Eve was tempted by a demon , but by \u201c the Serpent; \u201d and that only because he was \u201c the most subtil of all the beasts of the field . \u201d Whatever interpretation the Rabbins and the Fathers may have put upon this , I take the words as I find them , and reply , with Bishop Watsonupon similar occasions , when the Fathers were quoted to him as Moderator in the schools of Cambridge , \u201c Behold the Book ! \u201d \u2014 holding up the Scripture . It is to be recollected , that my present subject has nothing to do with the New Testament , to which no reference can be here made without anachronism .With the poems upon similar topics I have not been recently familiar . Since I was twenty I have never read Milton ; but I had read him so frequently before , that this may make little difference . Gesner 's \u201c Death of Abel \u201d I have never read since I was eight years of age , at Aberdeen . The general impression of my recollection is delight ; but of the contents I remember only that Cain 's wife was called Mahala , and Abel 's Thirza ; in the following pages I have called them \u201c Adah \u201d and \u201c Zillah , \u201d the earliest female names which occur in Genesis . They were those of Lamech 's wives : those of Cain and Abel are not called by their names . Whether , then , a coincidence of subject may have caused the same in expression , I know nothing , and care as little .am prepared to be accused of Manicheism ,or some other hard name ending in ism , which makes a formidable figure and awful sound in the eyes and ears of those who would be as much puzzled to explain the terms so bandied about , as the liberal and pious indulgers in such epithets . Against such I can defend myself , or , if necessary , I can attack in turn . \u201c Claw for claw , as Conan said to Satan and the deevil take the shortest nails \u201d] The reader will please to bear in mind, that there is no allusion to a future state in any of the books of Moses , nor indeed in the Old Testament . For a reason for this extraordinary omission he may consult Warburton 's \u201c Divine Legation ; \u201dwhether satisfactory or not , no better has yet been assigned . I have therefore supposed it new to Cain , without , I hope , any perversion of Holy Writ . With regard to the language of Lucifer , it was difficult for me to make him talk like a clergyman upon the same subjects ; but I have done what I could to restrain him within the bounds of spiritual politeness . If he disclaims having tempted Eve in the shape of the Serpent , it is only because the book of Genesis has not the most distant allusion to anything of the kind , but merely to the Serpent in his serpentine capacity .", "You talk unwarily . \u2018 Twere best they hear not", "You talk but idly .", "And I \u2014\u2014", "\u2018 Twas his own wish that all should be done promptly . 120"]}, "act_index": 210, "play_index": 15}, {"data": {"1368": ["I am the son of Marco Memmo ."]}, "act_index": 210, "play_index": 15}, {"data": {"1369": ["But thou my eldest born ? art silent still ?", "Who out of darkness on the deep didst make", "Blaspheme not : these are Serpent 's words .", "Son Cain ! my first-born \u2014 wherefore art thou silent ?", "Oh ! my son ,", "Light on the waters with a word \u2014 All Hail !", "Each to his task of toil \u2014 not heavy , though", "Wherefore so ?", "We have , most fervently .", "So will God , I trust ."]}, "act_index": 210, "play_index": 15}, {"data": {"1370": ["Who didst divide the wave from wave , and call", "The fruit of our forbidden tree begins 30", "Behold thy father cheerful and resigned \u2014", "To fall .", "Morning from night , till then divided never \u2014", "The snares beyond the walls of Paradise ,", "My misery in thine .

INTRODUCTION TO THE DEFORMED TRANSFORMED . The date of the original MS. of The Deformed Transformed is \u201c Pisa , 1822 . \u201d There is nothing to show in what month it was written , but it may be conjectured that it was begun and finished within the period which elapsed between the death of Allegra , April 20 , and the death of Shelley , July 8 , 1822 . According to Medwin, an unfavourable criticism of Shelley 's, together with a discovery that \u201c two entire lines \u201d of Southey 's \u2014 \u201c And water shall see thee , And fear thee , and flee thee \u201d \u2014 were imbedded in one of his \u201c Songs , \u201d touched Byron so deeply that he \u201c threw the poem into the fire , \u201d and concealed the existence of a second copy for more than two years . It is a fact that Byron 's correspondence does not contain the remotest allusion to The Deformed Transformed ; but , with regard to the plagiarism from Southey , in the play as written in 1822 there is neither Song nor Incantation which could have contained two lines from The Curse of Kehama . As a dramatist , Byron 's function , or m\u00e9tier , was twofold . In Manfred , in Cain , in Heaven and Earth , he is concerned with the analysis and evolution of metaphysical or ethical notions ; in Marino Faliero , in Sardanapalus , and The Two Foscari , he set himself \u201c to dramatize striking passages of history ; \u201d in The Deformed Transformed he sought to combine the solution of a metaphysical puzzle or problem , the relation of personality to individuality , with the scenic rendering of a striking historical episode , the Sack of Rome in 1527 . In the note or advertisement prefixed to the drama , Byron acknowledges that \u201c the production \u201d is founded partly on the story of a forgotten novel , The Three Brothers , and partly on \u201c the Faust of the great Goethe . \u201d Arnaud , or Julian , the hero of The Three Brothers, \u201c sells his soul to the Devil , and becomes an arch-fiend in order to avenge himself for the taunts of strangers on the deformity of his person \u201dThe idea of an escape from natural bonds or disabilities by supernatural means and at the price of the soul or will , the un-Christlike surrender to the tempter , which is the grund-stoff of the Faust-legend , was brought home to Byron , in the first instance , not by Goethe , or Calderon , or Marlowe , but by Joshua Pickersgill . A fellow-feeling lent an intimate and peculiar interest to the theme . He had suffered all his life from a painful and inconvenient defect , which his proud and sensitive spirit had magnified into a deformity . He had been stung to the quick by his mother 's taunts and his sweetheart 's ridicule , by the jeers of the base and thoughtless , by slanderous and brutal paragraphs in newspapers . He could not forget that he was lame . If his enemies had but possessed the wit , they might have given him \u201c the sobriquet of Le Diable Boiteux \u201dIt was no wonder that so poignant , so persistent a calamity should be \u201c reproduced in his poetry \u201d, or that his passionate impatience of such a \u201c thorn in the flesh \u201d should picture to itself a mysterious and unhallowed miracle of healing . It is true , as Moore says, that \u201c the trifling deformity of his foot \u201d was the embittering circumstance of his life , that it \u201c haunted him like a curse ; \u201d but it by no means follows that he seriously regarded his physical peculiarity as a stamp of the Divine reprobation , that \u201c he was possessed by an id\u00e9e fixe that every blessing would be \u2018 turned into a curse \u2019 to him \u201dNo doubt he indulged himself in morbid fancies , played with the extravagances of a restless imagination , and wedded them to verse ; but his intellect , \u201c brooding like the day , a master o'er a slave , \u201d kept guard . He would never have pleaded on his own behalf that the tyranny of an id\u00e9e fixe , a delusion that he was predestined to evil , was an excuse for his shortcomings or his sins . Byron 's very considerable obligations to The Three Brothers might have escaped notice , but the resemblance between his \u201c Stranger , \u201d or \u201c C\u00e6sar , \u201d and the Mephistopheles of \u201c the great Goethe \u201d was open and palpable . If Medwin may be trusted, Byron had read \u201c Faust in a sorry French translation , \u201d and it is probable that Shelley 's inspired rendering of \u201c May-day Night , \u201d which was published in The Liberal, had been read to him , and had attracted his attention . The Deformed Transformed is \u201c a Faustish kind of drama ; \u201d and Goethe , who maintained that Byron 's play as a whole was \u201c no imitation , \u201d but \u201c new and original , close , genuine , and spirited , \u201d could not fail to perceive that \u201c his devil was suggested by my Mephistopheles \u201dThe tempter who cannot resist the temptation of sneering at his own wiles , who mocks for mocking 's sake , is not Byron 's creation , but Goethe 's . Lucifer talked at the clergy , if he did not \u201c talk like a clergyman ; \u201d but the \u201c bitter hunchback , \u201d even when he is solus , sneers as the river wanders , \u201c at his own sweet will . \u201d He is not a doctor , but a spirit of unbelief ! The second part of The Deformed Transformed represents , in three scenes , the Siege and Sack of Rome in 1527 . Byron had read Robertson 's Charles the Fifthin his boyhood, but it is on record that he had studied , more or less closely , the narratives of contemporary authorities . A note to The Prophecy of Danterefers to the Sacco di Roma , descritto da Luigi Guicciardini , and the Ragguaglio Storico ... sacco di Roma dell \u2019 anno MDXXVII . of Jacopo Buonaparte ; and it is evident that he was familiar with Cellini 's story of the marvellous gests and exploits quorum maxima pars fuit , which were wrought at \u201c the walls by the Campo Santo , \u201d or on the ramparts of the Castle of San Angelo . The Sack of Rome was a great national calamity , and it was something more : it was a profanation and a sacrilege . The literature which it evoked was a cry of anguish , a prophetic burden of despair . \u201c Chants populaires , \u201d writes M. Emile Gebhart, \u201c Nouvelles de Giraldi Cintio , en forme de D\u00e9cam\u00e9ron ... r\u00e9cits historiques ... de C\u00e9sar Grollier , Dialogues anonymes ... po\u00e9sies de Pasquin , toute une litt\u00e9rature se developpa sur ce th\u00e8me douloureux .... Le Lamento di Roma , \u0153uvre \u00e9trange , d'inspiration gibeline , rappelle les esp\u00e9rances politiques exprim\u00e9es jadis par Dante ... \u2018 Bien que C\u00e9sar m'ait d\u00e9pouille\u00e9 de libert\u00e9 , nous avons toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 d'accord dans une m\u00eame volont\u00e9 . Je ne me lamenterais pas si lui r\u00e9gnait ; mais je crois qu'il est ressuscit\u00e9 , ou qu'il ressuscitera v\u00e9ritablement , car souvent un Ange m'a annonc\u00e9 qu'un C\u00e9sar viendrait me d\u00e9livrer . \u2019 ... Enfin , voici une chanson fran\u00e7aise que r\u00e9p\u00e9taient en repassant les monts les soldats du Marquis de Saluces :\u2014 \u201c Parlons de la d\u00e9ffaiete De ces pouvres Rommains , Aussi de la complainete De notre p\u00e8re saint . \u201c \u2018 O noble roy de France , Regarde en piti\u00e9 L'Eglise en ballance ... Pour Dieu ! ne tarde plus , C'est ta m\u00e8re , ta substance ; O fils , n'en faictz reffus . \u2019 \u201d \u201c Le dernier monument , \u201d adds M. Gebhart , in a footnote , \u201c de cette litt\u00e9rature , est le singulier drame de Byron , The Deformed Transformed , dont Jules C\u00e9sar est le h\u00e9ros , et le Sac de Rome le cadre . \u201d It is unlikely that Byron , who read everything he could lay his hands upon , and spared no trouble to master his \u201c period , \u201d had not , either at first or second hand , acquainted himself with specimens of this popular literature ., Scelta di Curiosit\u00e0 , etc ., 235 , 236 , 237 , Bologna , 1890 , vol . iii .

FOOTNOTES :{ 473 }\u2014 \u201c Arnaud , the natural son of the Marquis de Souvricour , was a child \u2018 extraordinary in Beauty and Intellect . \u2019 When travelling with his parents to Languedoc , Arnaud being 8 years old , he was shot at by banditti , and forsaken by his parents . The Captain of the band nursed him . \u2018 But those perfections to which Arnaud owed his existence , ceased to adorn it . The ball had gored his shoulder , and the fall had dislocated it ; by the latter misadventure his spine likewise was so fatally injured as to be irrecoverable to its pristine uprightness . Injuries so compound confounded the Captain , who sorrowed to see a creature so charming , at once deformed by a crooked back and an excrescent shoulder . \u2019 Arnaud was found and taken back to his parents . \u2018 The bitterest consciousness of his deformity was derived from their indelicate , though , perhaps , insensible alteration of conduct .... Of his person he continued to speak as of an abhorrent enemy .... \u201c Were a blessing submitted to my choice , I would say ,be it my immediate dissolution . \u201d \u201c I think , \u201d said his mother , ... \u201c that you could wish better . \u201d \u201c Yes , \u201d adjoined Arnaud , \u201c for that wish should be that I ever had remained unborn . \" \u2019 He polishes the broken blade of a sword , and views himself therein ; the sight so horrifies him that he determines to throw himself over a precipice , but draws back at the last moment . He goes to a cavern , and conjures up the prince of hell . \u201c Arnaud knew himself to be interrogated . What he required .... What was that answer the effects explain .... There passed in liveliest portraiture the various men distinguished for that beauty and grace which Arnaud so much desired , that he was ambitious to purchase them with his soul . He felt that it was his part to chuse whom he would resemble , yet he remained unresolved , though the spectator of an hundred shades of renown , among which glided by Alexander , Alcibiades , and Hephestion : at length appeared the supernatural effigy of a man , whose perfections human artist never could depict or insculp \u2014 Demetrius , the son of Antigonus . Arnaud 's heart heaved quick with preference , and strait he found within his hand the resemblance of a poniard , its point inverted towards his breast . A mere automaton in the hands of the Demon , he thrust the point through his heart , and underwent a painless death . During his trance , his spirit metempsychosed from the body of his detestation to that of his admiration ... Arnaud awoke a Julian ! \u2019 \u201d ]{ 474 }, see \u201c First Visit to the Theatre in London , \u201d Poems , by Hartley Coleridge , 1851 , i ., Appendix C , pp . cxcix. - cciii . The Wood Demon in its original form was never published . ]\u201c This had long been a favourite subject with Lord Byron . I think that he mentioned it also in Switzerland . I copied it \u2014 he sending a portion of it at a time , as it was finished , to me . At this time he had a great horror of its being said that he plagiarised , or that he studied for ideas , and wrote with difficulty . Thus he gave Shelley Aikins \u2019 edition of the British poets , that it might not be found in his house by some English lounger , and reported home ; thus , too , he always dated when he began and when he ended a poem , to prove hereafter how quickly it was done . I do not think that he altered a line in this drama after he had once written it down . He composed and corrected in his mind . I do not know how he meant to finish it ; but he said himself that the whole conduct of the story was already conceived . It was at this time that a brutal paragraphalluding to his lameness appeared , which he repeated to me lest I should hear it from some one else . No action of Lord Byron 's life \u2014 scarce a line he has written \u2014 but was influenced by his personal defect . \u201dIt is possible that Mrs. Shelley alludes to a sentence in the Memoirs , etc ., of Lord Byron ., 1822 , p. 46 : \u201c A malformation of one of his feet , and other indications of a rickety constitution , served as a plea for suffering him to range the hills and to wander about at his pleasure on the seashore , that his frame might be invigorated by air and exercise . \u201d ]{ 477 } The Deformed \u2014 a drama .\u2014 B . Pisa , 1822 .quotes these lines in connection with a passage in Byron 's \u201c Memoranda , \u201d where , in speaking of his own sensitiveness on the subject of his deformed foot , he described the feeling of horror and humiliation that came over him , when his mother , in one of her fits of passion , called him \u201c a lame brat ! \u201d ... \u201c It may be questioned , \u201d he adds , \u201c whether that whole dramawas not indebted for its origin to that single recollection . \u201d Byron 's early lettersare full of complaints of his mother 's \u201c eccentric behaviour , \u201d her \u201c fits of phrenzy , \u201d her \u201c caprices , \u201d \u201c passions , \u201d and so forth ; and there is convincing proof \u2014 see Life , pp . 28 , 306 ; Letters , 1898 , ii . 122; Letters , 1901 , vi . 179\u2014 that he regarded the contraction of the muscles of his legs as a more or less repulsive deformity . And yet , to quote one of a hundred testimonies ,\u2014 \u201c with regard to Lord Byron 's features , Mr. Mathews observed , that he was the only man he ever contemplated , to whom he felt disposed to apply the word beautiful \u201dThe looker-on or the consoler computes the magnitude and the liberality of the compensation .

Not long afterwards he lost the king 's favour , who was set against him by his mother , Louise de Savoie ; was recalled from his command in Italy , and superseded by Odet de Foix , brother of the king 's mistress . It was not , however , till he became a widowerthat he finally broke with Francis and attached himself to the Emperor Charles V. Madame , the king 's mother , not only coveted the vast estates of the house of Bourbon , but was enamoured of the Constable 's person , and , so to speak , gave him his choice between marriage and a suit for his fiefs . Charles would have nothing to say to the lady 's proposals or to her son 's entreaties , and seeing that rejection meant ruin , he \u201c entered into a correspondence with the Emperor and the Kingof England ... and , finding this discovered , went into the Emperor 's service . \u201d After various and varying successes , both in the South of France and in Lombardy , he found himself , in the spring of 1527 , not so much the commander-in-chief as the popular capo of a mixed body of German , Spanish , and Italian condottieri , unpaid and ill-disciplined , who had mutinied more than once , who could only be kept together by the prospect of unlimited booty , and a timely concession to their demands . \u201c To Rome ! to Rome ! \u201d cried the hungry and tumultuous landsknechts , and on May 5 , 1527 , the \u201c late Constable of France , \u201d at the head of an army of 30 , 000 troops , appeared before the walls of the sacred city .
