He gives it to the florist . \u201c I wish that to go into the box where it will be found the first thing . \u201d He turns away , and encounters the lady 's eyes as she chances to look toward him . \u201c I beg your pardon !

Where are those white roses with the pink tinge on the edge of the petals ? \u201d The florist pushes the box towards her , and she looks down at the roses . \u201c No , they wo n't do . They look somehow \u2014 cruel ! I do n't wonder he would n't have them . They are totally out of character . I will take those white Bride roses , too .

Well , now you must come to my Saturdays ; you are just in time for the first one . Some one you know is going to pour tea for me . That ought to be some consolation to you for not having stayed away long enough to escape my hospitalities . \u201d The Young Man , blushing and smiling : \u201c Oh , it 's a very charming welcome home .

I suppose you have nothing like the old-fashioned blush-rose ?

Dodder , they call it . \u201d", "\u201c Oh , loads . As many as you think I ought to have . I shall not have any other flowers , and I mean to toss them on the table in loose heaps .

Therefore , earlier in the act he emphasizes as follows :", "William Archer , in his Play-Making , declares that \u201c a crisis \u201d is the central matter in drama , but one immediately wishes to know what constitutes a crisis , and we have defined without defining . When he says elsewhere that that is dramatic which \u201c by representation of imaginary personages is capable of interesting an average audience assembled in a theatre , \u201dhe almost hits the truth . If we rephrase this definition : \u201c That is dramatic which by representation of imaginary personages interests , through its emotions , an average audience assembled in a theatre , \u201d we have a definition which will better stand testing . Is all dramatic material , theatric ? No , for theatric does not necessarily mean sensational , melodramatic , artificial . It should mean , and it will be so used in this book , adapted for the purpose of the theatre . Certainly all dramatic material , that is , material which arouses or may be made to arouse emotion , is not fitted for use in the theatre when first it comes to the hand of the dramatist . Undeniably , the famous revivalists , Moody , J. B. Gough , Billy Sunday , have worked from emotions to emotions ; that is , they have been dramatic . Intentionally , feeling themselves justified by the ends obtained , they have , too , been theatric in the poor and popular sense of the word , namely , exaggerated , melodramatic , sensational . Yet theatric in the best sense of the word these highly emotional speakers , who have swept audiences out of all self-control , have not been . They worked as speakers , not as playwrights . Though they sometimes acted admirably , what they presented was in no sense a play . To accomplish in play form what they accomplished as speakers , that is , to make the material properly theatric , would have required an entire reworking . From all this it follows that even material so emotional in its nature as to be genuinely dramatic may need careful reworking if it is to succeed as a play , that is , if it is to become properly theatric . Drama , then , is presentation of an individual or group of individuals so as to move an audience to responsive emotion of the kind desired by the dramatist and to the amount required . This response must be gained under the conditions which a dramatist finds or develops in a theatre ; that is , dramatic material must be made theatric in the right sense of the word before it can become drama .", "Henry Arthur Jones protests against complete disuse of the aside . \u201c In discarding the \u2018 aside \u2019 in modern drama we have thrown away a most valuable and , at times , a most necessary convention . Let any one glance at the \u2018 asides \u2019 of Sir John Brute in The Provoked Wife , and he will see what a splendid instrument of rich comedy the \u2018 aside \u2019 may become . How are we as spectators to know what one character on the stage thinks of the situation and of the other characters , unless he tells us ; or unless he conveys it by facial play and gestures which are the equivalent of an \u2018 aside \u2019 ? The \u2018 aside \u2019 is therefore as legitimate a convention of drama as the removal of the fourth wall . More and more the English modern drama seems to be sacrificing everything to the mean ambition of presenting an exact photograph of real life . \u201dOf course Mr. Jones is quite right in wishing to keep the aside for cases in which it is perfectly natural . His illustration of Sir John Brute is , however , not wholly fortunate , for his asides are not conventional but are characterizing touches . Surely we must all admit that a certain type of drunkard likes to mumble to himself insulting speeches which he has n't quite the courage to speak directly to other people , but rather hopes they may overhear . Study the asides of Sir John Brute \u2014 they are not very many after all \u2014 and note that practically every one might be said directly to the people on the stage . All of them help to present Sir John as the heavy drinker who talks to himself and selects for his speeches to himself his particularly insulting remarks . Why , too , are \u201c facial play and gestures \u201d more objectionable than the conventional aside ? The fundamental trouble with the aside which should not be overheard by people on the stage is that , if spoken naturally , it would be too low for the audience to hear , and if spoken loud enough to be heard , would so affect the other characters as to change materially the development of the scene . The aside should , therefore , be used with great care . Congreve , writing of ordinary human speech said , \u201c I believe if a poet should steal a dialogue of any length , from the extempore discourse of the two wittiest men upon earth , he would find the scene but coldly received by the town . \u201dIn everyday speech , that is , we do not say our say in the most compact , characteristic , and entertaining fashion . To gain all that , we must use more concentration and selection than we give to ordinary human intercourse . Just that concentration of attention , which produces needed selection , a dramatist must give his dialogue . To this concentration and selection he is forced by the time difficulty already explained . Into the period sometimes consumed by a single bit of gossiping , perhaps shot through with occasional flashes of wit , but more probably dull ,\u2014 into the space of two hours and a quarter ,\u2014 the dramatist must crowd all the happenings , the growth of his characters , and the close reasoning of his play . Dramatic dialogue is human speech so wisely edited for use under the conditions of the stage that far more quickly than under ordinary circumstances the events are presented , in character , and perhaps in a phrasing delightful of itself . Picking just the right words to convey with gesture , voice and the other stage aids of dialogue the emotions of the characters is so exacting a task that many a writer tries to dodge it . He thinks that by prefacing nearly every speech with \u201c Tenderly , \u201d \u201c Sarcastically , \u201d \u201c With much humor , \u201d in other words a statement as to how his lines should be read , commonplace phrasings may be made to pass for the right emotional currency . This is a lazy trick of putting off on the actor what would be the delight of the writer if he really cared for his work and knew what he wished to say . Of course , from time to time one needs such stage directions , but the safest way is to insist , in early drafts , on making the text convey the desired emotion without such statements . Otherwise a writer easily falls into writing unemotionalized speeches , the stage directions of which call upon the actor to provide the emotion . A similar trick is to write incomplete sentences , usually ending with dashes . Though it is true , as Carlyle long ago pointed out , that a thought or a climax which a reader or hearer completes for himself is likely to give him special satisfaction , the device is easily overdone , and too often the uncompleted line means either that the author does not know exactly what he wishes to say , or that , though he knows , the hearer or reader may not complete the thought as he does . The worst of this last trick is that it may confuse the reader and , as was explained earlier in this chapter , clearness in gaining the desired effect is the chief essential in dialogue . An allied difficulty comes from writing dialogue in blocks , the author forgetting , in the first place , that the other people on the stage are likely to interrupt and break up such speech , and secondly , that when several ideas are presented to an audience in the same speech , they are likely to confuse hearers . In these parallel passages from the two quartos of Hamlet , is not the right-hand column , with its mingling of rapidly exchanged speech and description , much more vivid and moving ?", "Sealand .

The chest and the head , gently upturned and deathly motionless , rest against the trunk of a giant hollow oak .

The dumb , fixed eyes no longer look out from the visible side of Eternity and seem to bleed with immemorial sorrows and with tears .

The hands , pitifully thin , are clasped rigidly over the thighs . On the right , six old men , all blind , are sitting on stones , stumps , and dead leaves . On the left , separated from them by an uprooted tree and fragments of rock , six women , also blind , are sitting opposite the old men . Three among them pray and mourn without ceasing , in a muffled voice . Another is old in the extreme . The fifth , in an attitude of mute insanity , holds on her knees a little sleeping child . The sixth is strangely young and her whole body is drenched with her beautiful hair . They , as well as the old men , are all clad in the same ample and sombre garments . Most of them are waiting , with their elbows on their knees and their faces in their hands ; and all seem to have lost the habit of ineffectual gesture and no longer turn their heads at the stifled and uneasy noises of the Island . Tall funereal trees ,\u2014 yews , weeping-willows , cypresses ,\u2014 cover them with their faithful shadows . A cluster of long , sickly asphodels is in bloom , not far from the priest , in the night . It is unusually oppressive , despite the moonlight that here and there struggles to pierce for an instant the glooms of the foliage . First Blind Man .He has n't come back yet ? Second Blind Man .You have awakened me . First Blind Man . I was sleeping , too . Third Blind Man .I was sleeping , too . First Blind Man . He has n't come yet ? Second Blind Man . I hear something coming . Third Blind Man . It is time to go back to the Asylum . First Blind Man . We ought to find out where we are . Second Blind Man . It has grown cold since he left . First Blind Man . We ought to find out where we are ! The Very Old Blind Man . Does any one know where we are ? The Very Old Blind Woman . We were walking a very long while ; we must be a long way from the Asylum . First Blind Man . Oh ! the women are opposite us ? The Very Old Blind Woman . We are sitting opposite you . First Blind Man . Wait , I am coming over where you are .Where are you ?\u2014 Speak ! let me hear where you are ! The Very Old Blind Woman . Here ; we are sitting on stones . First Blind Man .There is something between us . Second Blind Man . We had better keep our places . Third Blind Man . Where are you sitting ?\u2014 Will you come over by us ? The Very Old Blind Woman . We dare not rise ! Third Blind Man . Why did he separate us ? First Blind Man . I hear praying on the women 's side . Second Blind Man . Yes ; the three old women are praying . First Blind Man . This is no time for prayer ! Second Blind Man . You will pray soon enough , in the dormitory !Third Blind Man . I should like to know who it is I am sitting by . Second Blind Man . I think I am next to you .Third Blind Man . We can n't reach each other . First Blind Man . Nevertheless , we are not far apart .The one who cannot hear is beside us . Second Blind Man . I do n't hear anybody ; we were six just now . First Blind Man . I am going to count . Let us question the women , too ; we must know what to depend upon . I hear the three old women praying all the time ; are they together ? The Very Old Blind Woman . They are sitting beside me , on a rock . First Blind Man . I am sitting on dead leaves . Third Blind Man . And the beautiful blind girl , where is she ? The Very Old Blind Woman . She is near them that pray . Second Blind Man . Where is the mad woman , and her child ? The Young Blind Girl . He sleeps ; do not awaken him ! First Blind Man . Oh ! How far away you are from us ! I thought you were opposite me ! Third Blind Man . We know \u2014 nearly \u2014 all we need to know . Let us chat a little , while we wait for the priest to come back .Many an inexperienced dramatist fails to see the force of these words of Maeterlinck : \u201c An old man , seated in his armchair , waiting patiently , with his lamp beside him \u2014 submitting with bent head to the presence of his soul and his destiny \u2014 motionless as he is does yet live in reality a deeper , more human , and more universal life than the lover who strangles his mistress , the captain who conquers in battle , or the husband who \u2018 avenges his honor . \u2019 \u201d If an audience can be made to feel and understand the strong but contained emotion of this motionless figure , he is rich dramatic material . In the extracts from La Princesse Georges , Faustus , The Romancers , The Blind , in the soliloquy of Hamlet referred to , and the illustration quoted from Maeterlinck , it is not physical outward expression but the vivid picture we get of a state of mind which stirs us . Surely all these cases prove that we must include mental as well as physical activity in any definition of the word dramatic . Provided a writer can convey to his audience the excited mental state of one or more of his characters , then this mental activity is thoroughly dramatic . That is , neither physical nor mental activity is in itself dramatic ; all depends on whether it naturally arouses , or can be made by the author to arouse , emotion in an audience . Just as we had to add to physical action which arouses emotional response of itself , physical action which is made to arouse response because it develops the story or illustrates character , we must now add action which is not physical , but mental . There is even another chance for confusion . A figure sitting motionless not because he is thinking hard but because blank in mind may yet be dramatic . Utter inaction , both physical and mental , of a figure represented on the stage does not mean that it is necessarily undramatic . If the dramatist can make an audience feel the terrible tragedy of the contrast between what might have been and what is for this perfectly quiet unthinking figure , he rouses emotion in his hearers , and in so doing makes his material dramatic . Suppose , too , that the expressionless figure is an aged father or mother very dear to some one in the play who has strongly won the sympathy of the audience . The house takes fire . The flames draw nearer and nearer the unconscious figure . We are made to look at the situation through the eyes of the character \u2014 some child or relative \u2014 to whom the scene , were he present , would mean torture . Instantly the figure , because of the way in which it is represented , becomes dramatic . Here again , however , the emotion of the audience could hardly be aroused except through characterization of the figure as it was or might have been , or of the child or relative who has won our sympathy . Again , too , characterization so successful must depend a good deal on well-chosen words . This somewhat elaborate analysis should have made three points clear . First , we may arouse emotion in an audience by mere physical action ; by physical action which also develops the story , or illustrates character , or does both ; by mental rather than physical action , if clearly and accurately conveyed to the audience ; and even by inaction , if characterization and dialogue by means of other figures are of high order . Secondly , as the various illustrations have been examined , it must have become steadily more clear that while action is popularly held to be central in drama , emotion is really the essential . Because it is the easiest expression of emotion to understand , physical action , which without illuminating characterization and dialogue can express only a part of the world of emotion , has been too often accepted as expressing all the emotion the stage can present . Thirdly , it should be clear that a statement one meets too frequently in books on the drama , that certain stories or characters , above all certain well-known books , are essentially undramatic material is at least dubious . The belief arises from the fact that the story , character , or idea , as usually presented , seems to demand much analysis and description , and almost to preclude illustrative action . In the past few years , however , the drama of mental states and the drama which has revealed emotional significance in seeming or real inaction , has been proving that \u201c nothing human is foreign \u201d to the drama . A dramatist may see in the so-called undramatic material emotional values . If so , he will develop a technique which will create in his public a satisfaction equal to that which the so-called undramatic story , character , or idea could give in story form . Of course he will treat it differently in many respects because he is writing not to be read but to be heard , and to affect the emotions , not of the individual , but of a large group taken as a group . He will prove that till careful analysis has shown in a given story , character , or idea , no possibility of arousing the same or dissimilar emotions in an audience , we cannot say that this or that is dramatic or undramatic , but only : \u201c This material will require totally different presentation if it is to be dramatic on the stage , and only a person of acumen , experience with audiences , and inventive technique can present it effectively . \u201d The misapprehension just analyzed rests not only on the misconception that action rather than emotion is the essential in drama , but also largely on a careless use of the word dramatic . In popular use this word means material for drama , or creative of emotional response , or perfectly fitted for production under the conditions of the theatre . If we examine a little , in the light of this chapter , the nature and purpose of a play , we shall see that dramatic should stand only for the first two definitions , and that theatric must be used for the third . Avoiding the vague definition material for drama , use dramatic only as creative of emotional response and the confusion will disappear . A play exists to create emotional response in an audience . The response may be to the emotions of the people in the play or the emotions of the author as he watches these people . Where would satirical comedy be if , instead of sharing the amusement , disdain , contempt or moral anger of the dramatist caused by his figures , we responded exactly to their follies or evil moods ? All ethical drama gets its force by creating in an audience the feelings toward the people in the play held by the author . Dumas fils , Ibsen , Brieux prove the truth of this statement . The writer of the satirical or the ethical play , obtruding his own personality as in the case of Ben Jonson , or with fine impersonality as in the case of Congreve or Moliere , makes his feelings ours . It is an obvious corollary of this statement that the emotions aroused in an audience need not be the same as those felt by the people on the stage . They may be in the sharpest contrast . Any one experienced in drama knows that the most intensely comic effects often come from people acting very seriously . In Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme, the morning reception of M. Jourdain affords an instance of this in his trying on of costumes , fencing , and lessons in dancing and language . Serious entirely for M. Jourdain they are as presented by Moliere , exquisitely comic for us . In brief , the dramatic may rouse the same , allied , or even contrasting emotions in an onlooker . Nor need the emotion roused in an audience by actor or author be exactly the same in amount . The actress who abandons herself to the emotions of the part she is playing soon exhausts her nervous vitality . It would be the same if audiences listening to the tragic were permitted to feel the scenes as keenly as the figures of the story . On the other hand , in some cases , if the comic figure on the stage felt his comicality as strongly as the audience which is speechless with laughter , he could not go on , and the scene would fail . Evidently , an audience may be made , as the dramatist wills , to feel more or less emotion than the characters of the play . That it is duplication of emotion to the same , a less , or a greater extent or the creation of contrasting emotion which underlies all drama , from melodrama , riotous farce and even burlesque to high-comedy and tragedy , must be firmly grasped if a would-be dramatist is to steer his way clearly through the many existing and confusing definitions of dramatic . For instance , Brunetiere said , \u201c Drama is the representation of the will of man in contrast to the mysterious powers of natural forces which limit and belittle us ; it is one of us thrown living upon the stage , there to struggle against fatality , against social law , against one of his fellow mortals , against himself , if need be , against the emotions , the interests , the prejudices , the folly , the malevolence of those around him . \u201dThat is , by this definition , conflict is central in drama . But we know that in recent drama particularly , the moral drifter has many a time aroused our sympathy . Surely inertness , supineness , stupidity , and even torpor may be made to excite emotion in an audience . Conflict covers a large part of drama but not all of it .", "No one !

Despair , conflict , and destruction .It is a truism , first , that Shakespeare wrote story plays , and secondly that he did not endeavor to imagine a new story . Instead , he made over plays grown out of date in his time , or adapted to the stage what today we should call novelettes which came to him in the original or translation from Italy , Spain , or France . Never did he find a story which seemed to him fully shaped and ready for the stage .The tales may be verbose and redundant ; they may be mere bare outlines of the action , little if at all characterized , with unreal dialogue ; or they may provide Shakespeare with only a part of the story he uses , the rest coming from other tales or from his own imagination . Widely different as they are , however , one and all they were points of departure for Shakespeare 's plays . No matter which one of the numerous starting points noted may be that of the dramatist , he must end in story even if he does not begin with it . Suppose that he starts with a character . He cannot merely talk about the figure . This might produce a kind of history ; it cannot produce drama . Inevitably , he will try to illustrate , by means of action , some one dominant characteristic , or group of characteristics , or to the full , the many-sided nature of the man . Very nearly the same thing may be said of any attempt to dramatize an historical epoch . Its chief characteristic or characteristics must be illustrated in action . Some story is inevitable . Suppose , for the moment , that as in Morose of Ben Jonson 's Silent Woman ,the dramatist is stressing one characteristic , in this instance morbid sensitiveness to noise of any kind . It is well known that Jonson cared more for character and less for story than most dramatists of his day . Yet even in this play we find the story of the tricking of Morose by his nephew , Dauphine , resulting in the marriage of Morose to Dauphine 's page . The reason why the three parts of Henry VI of Shakespeare are little read and very rarely acted is not merely that they are somewhat crude early work , but that crowding incident of all kinds lacks the massing needed to give it clearness of total effect to round it out into a well-told story . Illustrative incidents , unrelated except that historically they happen to the same person , and that historically they are given in proper sequence , are likely to be confusing . We need the Baedeker of a biographer or an historian to emphasize the incidents so that the meaning they have for him may be clear to us . The first part of Marlowe 's Tamburlaine ,when quickly read , seems but a succession of conquests , not greatly unlike , leading to his control of the world of his day . He who sees no deeper into the play than this praises certain scenes or passages , but finds the whole repetitious and confusing . Closer examination shows , however , that behind these many incidents of war and slaughter is an interest of Marlowe 's own creation which keeps us waiting for , anticipating the final scene \u2014 the desire of Zenocrate , at first captive of Tamburlaine , and later his devoted wife , to reconcile her father , the Soldan , and her husband . The satisfaction of her desire makes the spectacular ending of Part I . This thread of interest gives a certain unity to the material presented , creates a slight story in the mass of incident ,\u2014 that is , something with a beginning , a middle , and an end . What gives unity to the Second Part of Tamburlaine is the idea that , even as Tamburlaine declares himself all-conquering , he faces unseen forces against which he cannot stand \u2014 the physical cowardice of his son , so incomprehensible to him that he kills the boy ; the illness and death of his beloved Zenocrate , though he spares nothing to save her ; his own growing physical weakness , his breakdown and death even as the generals he has never called on in vain before prove unable to aid him . Again we find an element of story to unify the material . A moment 's thought will show that if , beginning with character we must ultimately reach some story , however slight , this is just as true of a play which begins with an idea , a bit of dialogue , a detached scene , or a mere setting . The setting must be the background of some incident . This , in turn , must be part of a story or we shall have the episodic form already found undesirable . Similarly , a detached scene must become part of a series of scenes . Get rid of the effect of episodic scenes , that is , give them unity , and lo , we have story of some sort . The bit of dialogue must become part of a larger dialogue belonging to characters of the play ; and characterization , as we have seen , results in some story . The artistic or moral idea of the dramatist can be made clear only by human figures , the pawns with which he makes his emotional moves . At once we are on the way to story . The Red Robeof Brieux aims to illustrate the idea that in France the administration of justice has been confused by personal ambition and personal intrigue . Is it without story ? Surely we have the story of Mouzon ,\u2014 his hopes , his consequent intrigues for advancement , and his resulting death . Here is a group of incidents developing something from a beginning to an end , that is , providing story . The play contains , too , the story of Yanetta and Etchepare . May we not say that the Vagret family provides a third story ? A play , then , may begin in almost anything seen or thought . Speaking broadly , there is no reason why one source is better than another . The important point is that something seen or thought should so stir the emotions of the dramatist that the desire to convey his own emotion or the emotions of characters who become connected with what he has seen or thought , forces him to write till he has worked out his purpose . Undoubtedly , however , he who begins with a story is nearer his goal than he who begins with an idea or a character . Disconnected episodes , then , may possibly make a vaudeville sketch or the libretto of a lower order of musical comedy . Unless unified in story , even though it be very slight , they cannot make a play . This point needs emphasis for two reasons : because lately there has been some attempt to maintain that a newer type of play has no story , and because many a beginner in dramatic writing seems to agree with Bayes in The Rehearsal . \u201c What the devil 's a plot except to stuff in fine things ? \u201d In good play-writing it is not a question of bringing together as many incidents or as many illustrations of character as you can crowd together in a given number of acts , but of selecting the illustrative incidents , which , when properly developed will produce in an audience the largest amount of the emotional response desired . Later this error will be considered in detail . Nor will the recent attempt to maintain that there is a new type of play with \u201c absolutely no story in it \u201d stand close analysis . The story may be very slight , but story is present in all such plays . Take two cases . Mr. William Archer , in his excellent book on Play-Making ,sums up Miss Elizabeth Baker 's Chainsas follows : \u201c A city clerk , oppressed by the deadly monotony of his life , thinks of going to Australia \u2014 and does n't go : that is the sum and substance of the action . Also , by way of underplot , a shopgirl , oppressed by the deadly monotony and narrowness of her life , thinks of escaping from it by marrying a middle-aged widower \u2014 and does n't do it . \u201d He then declares that the play has \u201c absolutely no story . \u201d Does any reader believe that this play could have succeeded , as it has , if the audience had been left in any doubt as to why the city clerk and the shopgirl did not do what they had planned ? Yet surely , if this play makes clear , as it does , why these two people changed their minds , it must have story , for it shows us people thinking of escaping from conditions they find irksome , and explains why they give up the idea . If that is n't story , what is it ? The Weavers of Hauptmann ,giving us somewhat loosely connected pictures of social conditions among the weavers of Germany in the forties of the nineteenth century , is said to be another specimen of these plays without story . Now such plays as The Weavers have one of two results : they rouse us to thought on the social conditions represented , or they do not . To succeed they must rouse us ; but if our stirred feelings are to lead anywhere , we must be not only stirred but clear as to the meaning of the play . There have been many who have thought that The Weavers , though it stirs us to sympathy , leaves us nowhere because not clear . Be this as it may , even The Weavers has some story , for it tells us of the rise and development of a revolt of the weavers against their employers . Confusion as to \u201c story \u201d results from two causes . First , story in drama is often taken to imply only complicated story . To say that every play must have complicated story is absurd . To say that every play must have some story , though it may be very slight , is undeniable . Secondly , story is frequently used to mean plot , and plot of the older type , namely a play of skilfully arranged suspense and climax in a story of complicated and extreme emotion . It is the second cause which underlies Mr. Archer 's curious statement about Chains . He says that the play has no \u201c emotional tension worth speaking of , \u201d and assumes that where there is no emotional tension there cannot be story . Tension in the sense of suspense the play has little , but Mr. Archer states that it held \u201c an audience absorbed through four acts \u201d and stirred \u201c them to real enthusiasm . \u201d In these words he grants the emotional response of the audience . Miss Baker substitutes sympathy for the characters and deft dealing with ironic valuesfor complicated plot and dependence on suspense . One kind of play , however , no more precludes story than another . What , then , is the difference between story and plot ? In treating drama , what should be meant by story is what a play boils down to when you try to tell a friend as briefly as possible what it is about \u2014 what Mr. Knobloch calls the vital active part , the \u201c verb \u201d of the play . Here is the story of the play , Barbara Frietchie , as it re-shaped itself in Clyde Fitch 's mind from Whittier 's poem :\u201c A Northern man loves a Southern girl . She defies her father and runs away to marry him . By a sudden battle the ceremony is prevented . The minister 's house is seized by the rebels , and soldiers stationed there . Barbara , who has remained , seeing a Confederate sharpshooter about to fire on her lover passing with his regiment , drops on her knees , slowly levels a gun she has seized , and shoots the Southerner . Her lover is wounded and she struggles to protect him from her father , brother , and rebel suitor , and from every little noise which might cost his life . He dies , and she , now wholly wedded to the Northern cause , waves the flag , as does the old woman in Whittier 's poem , in defiance of the Southern army , and is shot by her crazy rebel lover . \u201dNote that this summary , though it makes the story clear , in no way presents the scenes of the play as to order , suspense , or climax . This is the story , not the plot of Barbara Frietchie . Plot , dramatically speaking , is the story so moulded by the dramatist as to gain for him in the theatre the emotional response he desires . In order to create and maintain interest , he gives his story , as seems to him wise , simple or complex structure ; and discerning elements in it of suspense , surprise , and climax , he reveals them to just the extent necessary for his purposes . Plot is story proportioned and emphasized so as to accomplish , under the conditions of the theatre , the purposes of the dramatist . Compare the plot of Barbara Frietchie with its story ."]}, "act_index": 6, "play_index": 6}, {"data": {"287": ["Whose souls were like our own .", "A patrol !", "They are keeping watch .", "They are coming up .", "Always !", "Another !", "Again , and louder than ever !", "Be still .", "We can go down for the moment .", "Is like a cross we carry", "Down there \u2014 wait \u2014 lean over ."]}, "act_index": 6, "play_index": 6}, {"data": {"288": ["Listen !", "Ouf !", "They wo n't tell you so in the town .", "They who go out by the Grand \u2019 fontaine pass this way .", "The Hussars !", "Chut !"]}, "act_index": 6, "play_index": 6}, {"data": {"289": ["But we on the frontiers see them .", "I am sure it is Jean 's voice ."]}, "act_index": 6, "play_index": 6}, {"data": {"290": ["I see \u2014", "What ?", "They have crossed the road .", "Only to see them gives me a queer feeling at the heart .", "I hear the breathing of their horses .", "It is strange \u2014 twenty times , a hundred times in Germany I have met the patrols of dragoons , or hussars , and admired their fine form .

Often dialogue which is clear sentence by sentence is , as a whole , somewhat confusing to an audience . Frequently a careful re-ordering of the parts of the speech , or of a group of speeches , will dispose of the trouble .

One constantly meets this fault in the earlier Miracle Plays before writers had come to understand that audiences care more for the human being in the situation than for the situation itself , and that only by representing a situation not for itself but as felt by the people involved can it be made fully interesting .

Too many writers , as has been said , do not hear their words but see them . Could any one who heard his words have penned the lines , \u201c She says she 's sure she 'll have a shock if she sees him . \u201d That time \u201c apt alliteration \u201d was so artful that , setting her trap , she caught a dramatist . Here is the amusing comment of a critic on an author 's protest that her lines have been misquoted and made to sound difficult to deliver : In the review of the \u2014\u2014 Theatre 's opening bill there occurred a line purporting to come from Miss Blank 's psychic play , The Turtle . Miss Blank writes , \u201c The line , which was either incorrectly spoken or heard , was not , \u2018 How does one know one is one 's self ? \u2019 but \u2018 How is one to know which is one 's real self when one feels so different with different people ? \u2019 \u201d Naturally the reviewer of a play is as open to mistakes in noting down lines as the actor is in speaking them , particularly if the author is much given to the \u201c one-one-one \u201d style of construction . If , however , Miss Blank prefers her own version of the sentence , she is welcome to it . Of course each writer is perfectly sure that his own ear will keep him from errors of this kind , but even the greatest err .

He is writing supposedly for people who , except on a few historical subjects , know nothing of his material . If so , as soon as possible , he must make them understand :who his people are ;where his people are ;the time of the play ; andwhat in the present and past relations of his characters causes the story . Is it any wonder that Ibsen , when writing The Pillars of Society , said : \u201c In a few days I shall have the first act ready ; and that is always the most difficult act of the play \u201d ?What has just been said as to ordering the details in preliminary exposition is equivalent to saying : Decide where , in this exposition , you will place your emphasis . What a dramatist is trying to do will not be clear throughout his play unless he knows how properly to emphasize his material , for it is above all else emphasis which reveals the meaning of a play . Right emphasis depends basally on knowing what exactly is the desired total effect of the piece ,\u2014 a picture , a thesis , a character study , or a story . Remember that Dumas fils said : \u201c You cannot very well know where you should come out , when you do n't know where you are going . \u201d Often , too , a play is either meant to set people thinking of undesirable social conditions , or to state a distinct thesis . With these two kinds particularly in mind , Mr. Galsworthy has said : \u201c A drama must be shaped so as to have a spire of meaning . \u201dWhatever we make prominent by repetition , by elaborate treatment , by the position given it in an act or in the play as a whole , or by striking illustration , we emphasize , for it stays in the memory and shapes the meaning of a play for an auditor . In Othello , why does Shakespeare bring forward Iago at the end of an act as chorus to his own villainy ? In order that the audience may not go astray as to the purposes of Iago and the general meaning of the play . Hence the soliloquies : \u201c Thus do I ever make my fool my purse , \u201d as well as \u201c And what 's he , then , that says I play the villain ? \u201d It might almost be said that good drama consists in right selection of necessary illustrative action and in right emphasis . Even though the general exposition of a play be clear , it is sure , without well-handled emphasis , to leave a confused effect . When a play runs away with its author , its emphasis is always bad . The cause of this trouble usually is that the author drifts or rushes on , as the case may be , lured by an idea which he tries to present dramatically ; or by the development of some character who , for the moment , possesses his imagination ; or by the handling of some scene of large dramatic possibilities . In a recent play meant to illustrate amusingly a series of situations arising from the gossip of a small town , Act I so ended that a reader could not tell whether the school principal , a woman dentist , or the atmosphere of gossip was meant to be of prime importance . Nor was this poor emphasis ever corrected anywhere . Result : a confusing play . A story-play in some respects of great merit failed in its total effect because the author never really knew whether it was a study of the deterioration of a young man 's character or of a mother 's self-sacrificing and redeeming love , a mere story-play , or a drama intended to drive home a central idea which , apparently , always eluded the author . Fine realism of detail , good characterization in places , and genuine if scattered interest could not carry this play to success . In another play , Act I ended with the failure of a well-intentioned friend to take a child from her father for her better bringing-up . Apparently , we were entering upon a study of parental affection . In Act II , however , this interest practically disappeared , and we were asked to give all our attention to the way in which a son-in-law was bringing ruin upon this same parent . In Act III , another cause for anxiety on the part of the parent appeared , the other disappearing . At the end of the play , however , we were expected to understand that the fond parent was in sight of calm weather . Proper emphasis which would have brought out the central idea illustrated by each of the acts was missing . In The Trap , a four-act play developed from a vaudeville sketch , lack of good emphasis went far to spoil an interesting play . In the original sketch , a woman , induced by lies of the villain , comes to the apartment of a man who has at one time been in love with her . She is determined to know whether what the villain has told her is true or not . All is a trap which the villain has set for her . From it the astuteness and quick decision of her former admirer rescue her . In the vaudeville sketch , it was the former lover who was the active person ,\u2014 advising , scheming , and controlling the situation . When this was made over , in Act I the heroine was the central figure ; in Act II the villain took this position away from her ; in Act III the hero , as in the original sketch , had the centre of the stage ; in Act IV there was an attempt to bring the heroine back into prominence , but she divided interest with the hero . As a result of this uncertain emphasis , the play seemed intended for the heroine but taken away from her by the greater human appeal of the hero . Just as the lecturer keeps clear from start to finish the main theme of his discourse and the bearing upon it of the various divisions of the work , the dramatist keeps his main purpose clear and also the relations to it of scenes and acts . This he does by well-handled emphasis . Othello , for instance , must have some proof which the audience will believe conclusive for him of Desdemona 's infidelity . This is the handkerchief which Iago tells Othello that Desdemona gave to Cassio .

I have heard that men are brutal , horrible . ... Oh !Enter Mrs. Erlynne , L .Soliloquy when a character is left alone on the stage is a perfect illustration of the difference between permanent and ephemeral technique . As a device for easy exposition , it has been popular from the beginning of drama till recently . Now , though one may use it in a rough draft , a technique which is likely to become permanent in this respect forces us to go over this draft , cutting soliloquy to mere action and the few exclamations which the character might utter under the circumstances . Soliloquy has no such permanent place in technique as have preliminary exposition , suspense , and climax . Soliloquy , when other people are on the stage and known by the speaker to be listening is also absurd . It is because of this fact that the dramatic or psychologic monologue , the form taken by a very large portion of Browning 's voluminous poetry , breaks down if we attempt to stage it . \u201c Some speaker is made to reveal his character , and , sometimes , by reflection , or directly , the character of some one else \u2014 to set forth some subtle and complex soul-mood , some supreme , all-determining movement or experience of a life , or , it may be , to ratiocinate subtly on some curious question of theology , morals , philosophy , or art . Now it is in strictly preserving the monologue character that obscurity often results . A monologue often begins with a startling abruptness , and the reader must read along some distance before he gathers what the beginning means . Take the monologue of Fra Lippo Lippi for example . The situation is necessarily left more or less unexplained . The poet says nothing in propria persona , and no reply is made to the speaker by the person or persons addressed . Sometimes a look , a gesture or a remark must be supposed on the part of the one addressed , which occasions a responsive remark . Sometimes a speaker imputes a question , and the reader is sometimes obliged to stop and consider whether a question is imputed by the speaker to the one he is addressing , or is a direct question of his own . This is often the case throughout The Ring and the Book . \u201d", "Yes , you gave me this fan today ; it was your birthday present .

What is it , in these women , that \u2014 different as they are \u2014 menaces the man and the artist Schilling ? It is a passion for possession , for absorption , a hunger of the nerves rather than of the heart . These modern women have abandoned the simple and sane preoccupations of their grandmothers ; the enormous garnered nervous energy that is no longer expended in household tasks and in childbearing strikes itself , beak and clawlike , into man . But man has not changed . His occupations are not gone . He cannot endure the double burden . That is why Gabriel Schilling , rather than be destroyed spiritually by these tyrannies and exactions , seeks a last refuge in the great and cleansing purity of the sea . \u2018 The modern malady of love is nerves . \u2019 \u201dIt is possible that all this may be derived from the play , but the Berlin audience which watched its first night left the theatre bewildered in more than one respect . There were a half-dozen opinions as to what this ugly story of a very weak man was meant to signify . Was it simply the tale of a weak man ? Was it meant to show , as Professor Lewisohn thinks , that creation in an artist not naturally weak at first may be killed if he is pursued by women selfish in their love ? Does the ending , however , show that Hanna is entirely selfish ? Does the play signify that the man who chooses to follow women rather than his art is lost ? Why is there so much emphasis on the awesomeness of Nature on the island ? Have these conditions of Nature anything to do with Schilling 's death ? If so , do they not mitigate the effect upon him of the women ? Lack of well-placed emphasis made Gabriel Schilling 's Flight a failure , interesting as were the questions it raised and masterly as is much of its characterization . Too often young dramatists forget that the beginning and the ending of acts and plays emphasize even when the author does not so intend . As in real life , it is first and final impressions , rather than intermediate , which count most . An able young dramatist complained that though he wished one of his characters to dominate Act I she certainly failed to do this . The trouble was that an attractive old gardener , the character who took the act away from the young woman , opened the play attractively characterized and closed Act I with effective speech and pantomime , when the woman was busy only with unimportant pantomime . The prominence unintentionally given to the old gardener emphasized him at the expense of the young woman . For the value of openings in emphasizing the meaning of the whole play , see Tennyson 's Becket as originally written , and as rearranged by Sir Henry Irving .Tennyson 's Becket begins with Henry and the future Archbishop at chess , talking of matters in state and church .

An important means of emphasis is contrast \u2014 in character , situation , and even dialogue . Melodrama has always rested , in large part , for its definite emotional appeals on sharply contrasted characters \u2014 the spotless hero , the double-dyed villain , the adventuress , and the heroine so innocent of the world as to provide unlimited dramatic situations . Recall the impetuous Julia and the gentle Sylvia of The Two Gentlemen of Verona . If it be said that such direct contrasting of dissimilar figures belongs more to the earlier plays of dramatists , this is not true . In The Gay Lord Quex ,contrast of the old and the young roues , Quex and Bastling , helps to make clear and to emphasize the point of the play . The Princess and the Butterflylargely depends upon contrast ,\u2014 among the restless women of Act I , the restless men of Act II , between the Princess and Sir George , between the love of Fay Zuliani for Sir George and that of Edward for the Princess . Contrast in situation was a great reliance with the Elizabethans and , even when very crudely used , remains popular with the American public today . So much pleasure did the Elizabethan derive from contrasted situation that he was willing to have it worked up as a separate sub-plot , at times very slightly connected with the main plot . Take The Changeling of Middleton : the titular part , written for comic value , deals with scenes in a madhouse ; the other intensely tragic plot of De Flores and Beatrice-Joanna is but slightly connected with it . Think of the grave-diggers in Hamlet , just before the burial of Ophelia , and , above all , consider in Macbeth the consummate use of a contrasting scene , in the porter at the gate just after the murder of Duncan . It is a sense of the value of contrasting situation which produces the best dramatic irony . When in Scene 2 , Act I , of Hindle Wakes , we listen to Alan Jeffcote 's father and mother planning for his marriage , the fine dramatic irony comes from the contrast we feel with the facts of his conduct , known to us from the preceding scene , which may make his marriage impossible . Dramatic irony depends on a preceding planting in the minds of the auditors of information which makes what is true contrast sharply with what the characters of the particular scene suppose to be true . Contrast , then , underlies dramatic irony . An audience , feeling the dramatic irony of a scene , is put into a state of suspense as to how and when the blow they anticipate will fall . Evidently , then , emphasis by means of contrast , when it results in dramatic irony , makes for dramatic suspense . Contrast may be used effectively in dialogue . The modern dramatist sometimes overdoes this use . Because he has observed that the greatest suffering of the strongest natures rarely finds expression in rich or varied speech , he tries to discover words which in their feebleness , their inappositeness , or their unexpected commonplaceness , contrast sharply with what a hearer feels is the intensity of the emotion behind them . This has given us in recent drama some dialogue unnatural in its tameness . This kind of contrast , however , when handled with real understanding , is extremely effective . In the parting of Laurie and the heroine in Iris ,the very commonplaceness of the details of which they talk shows that they do not dare to speak of what is really in their minds , and makes the best preparation for the sudden loosing of emotion by Iris in what would be ordinarily a simple request : \u201c Close the jalousies ! \u201d Except in our recent revival of Moralities for the delectation of moral Broadway , we are growing away dramatically from mere contrasting of types of character and from plays in which a serious and a comic plot are but loosely connected . Yet dramatists will always find contrast highly useful in emphasizing points of characterization and important values in the story . Moreover , any trained dramatist knows that when his audience has been somewhat exhausted by laughter or tears , a scene of contrasting emotional value is of the highest importance . By changing the focus of interest , it renews the power of response exhausted in the just preceding scene . As has been pointed out again and again , though it may be true that the drunken porter in Macbeth was funnier for an Elizabethan public than he is today , nevertheless his coming breaks the tension of the terrible murder scene and makes it possible even now to turn to fresh horrors with surer responsiveness . There is no space here to go into any satisfactory analysis of the basal relations between the serious and the comic , but every competent actor knows that frequently , if the full desired comic values are to appear , it is necessary to play a part , or all the parts , with great seriousness , even in a piece meant to be broadly comic for the audience . This is true not merely in some of Shaw 's plays ,\u2014 Man and Superman , You Never Can Tell , etc ., but in many old farces and even in burlesque . In the contrast the audience makes between the seriousness of the characters in what they do and say and the attitude the dramatist creates toward them lie the real comic values . Often it is only on the flint of the serious that one may strike the most brilliant spark of the comic . Emphasis is needed not only to keep clear the development of the story and its thesis , if there be any , but also to determine and maintain the dramatic form in which it is cast \u2014 farce , comedy , melodrama , and tragedy . If an audience is kept long in the dark as to whether the dramatist is thinking of his material seriously or with amusement , or if they feel at the end that the story has been told with no coordinating emphasis to determine whether it is farce or comedy or tragedy , they are confused and likely to hold back part of their proper responsiveness . As has been pointed out , it is more than doubtful whether the scene of the attempted suicide in what is otherwise a genuine comedy of character , The Girl with the Green Eyes ,did not seriously hurt the effectiveness of the play for a great many people . Here , again , beginnings and endings are of the utmost consequence . Notice the extreme care of Maeterlinck , at the outset of Pelleas and Melisandeto create a mood for his play . One is prepared for the tragic and the mysterious by the opening scene of the handmaidens washing the mysterious stain from the palace steps . An auditor has not heard ten speeches of Synge 's Riders to the Seabefore he knows that the dramatist is dealing seriously with grim matters , that , in all probability , the play is a tragedy . Look at Rostand 's The Romancers .It is to be a graceful telling of a jest played upon two sentimental children by two fond fathers . The author must make clear early in the play that what may be tragic enough for the young people is to be fantastic comedy for any hearers . Could anything be better than the opening : these two children , on the wall between their homes , so reading Romeo and Juliet together that it is obvious that they are in love with being in love , nothing more ? There is the perfect emphasis which establishes early the attitude of the dramatist toward his material , in this case making the play poetic comedy . Can any one feel much doubt what form of drama is The Importance of Being Earnest ?The first few pages show that dialogue is to count heavily as such . Evidently the mood is comic . As evidently , there is exaggeration . Thus we move from initial farce to the more broadly farcical mourning for the death of the supposititious Earnest and to the fateful black handbag . If the ending of The Romancers be played as it was in London , with the speakers of the last lines gradually fading from sight in the dimming lights , surely that emphasis must mean to the audience that it has been seeing a fantasy .However , as has been said , danger lurks in these places of easy emphasis , the beginning and the ending , for at times something effective in itself swings the emphasis the wrong way . In Masks and Faces ,two generations have shed tears over the woes of Triplet as meant for \u201c real life , \u201d only to be somewhat rebuffed when , just before the final curtain , all the characters step out of the play for the \u201c Epilogue , \u201d and so stamp it as \u201c only a story after all . \u201d In brief , unless some special purpose is subserved thereby , an audience should not long be left in the dark as to the form in which the dramatist thinks he has cast his play . He who treats his material in many different moods runs the chance of confusing his hearers . Only by sure and well-placed emphasis can he keep his chosen form clear . Particularly is this true in the mixed forms , tragi-comedy and farce-comedy . Only well-placed emphasis will carry an audience through these with just the result desired by the dramatist . How decide what to emphasize ? Tom Taylor , despising the intelligence of audiences of his day , used to say , \u201c When you have something to say to an audience , tell them you are going to say it . Tell them you \u2018 re saying it . Tell them you 've said it . Then , perhaps , they 'll understand it . \u201d Truth probably lies between this and the statement of a dramatist of today , \u201c I am re-writing a play originally composed some ten years ago . Do you know what I am doing ? I am cutting and condensing , because the intervening years have taught me that I may suggest where I thought I must explain in full , and state but once what I thought I must repeat . Audiences are far quicker than ten years ago I supposed them to be . \u201d Till the training of the dramatist gives him a kind of sixth sense which tells him what in his plot needs emphasis for his public , he must depend on the comments of really intelligent hearers to whom he reads the manuscript and , above all , on retouching his play after the first performances . It is not enough , however , by clearness and right emphasis to maintain interest : as the play develops , the interest should if possible be increased . Either to maintain or to increase interest means that a hearer must be led on from scene to scene , act to act , absorbed while the curtain is up and , between the acts , eager for it to rise again . Such attention given a play means that it has a third essential quality , movement . The plays of tyro dramatists today are often sadly lacking in good movement . Good movement rests , first of all , on clearness ; secondly , on right emphasis ; and thirdly , on something already mentioned in connection with both clearness and right emphasis ,\u2014 suspense . This means a straining forward of interest , a compelling desire to know what will happen next . Whether a hearer is totally at a loss to know what will happen , but eager to ascertain ; partly guesses what will take place , but deeply desires to make sure ; or almost holds back so greatly does he dread an anticipated situation , he is in a state of suspense , for be it willingly or unwillingly on his part , on sweeps his interest . There should be good movement within the scene , the act , and even the play as a whole . It is , however , easily checked . If scenes or characters not essential are allowed place within a play , it has been shown on pages 87-89 that this may interfere with either clearness or good emphasis . They will hurt the movement of the play . Closely related as a possible danger are necessary scenes not well placed . Often shifting part of a scene or act makes all the difference between sustained and interrupted suspense . For example , a young man , after some quarrelsome words , threatens to shoot his sister . As they stand facing each other , steps are heard outside . A group which enters brings about an amusing scene . Good as it is , it may kill the suspense created by those two tense figures , if it switches interest wholly or in large part from them . If it does , any effective picking up the scene between the angry brother and sister , when the visitors go out , may be impossible . On the other hand , so write the scene that the audience , never diverted in its attention to those two figures , feels that the moment the visitors leave the quarrel will be resumed with greater intensity just because of the interruption : then there will be no loss of tension . Just here lies the important point : suspense once created must never be allowed to lapse so long as to be lost . A scene for contrast or to renew the power of desired emotional response in the audience or to develop part of a correlated story may be introduced , but always what is put between something which makes the audience strain forward and its goal should leave it as eager , and preferably more eager for the solution . A shift in order may do much to increase suspense . When Ibsen transferred Rosmer 's confession , which is very necessary to the play , from Act II to the end of Act I , he greatly added to the suspense created by the first act . To put it differently , he greatly accelerated the movement of the play . An audience , knowing that Rosmer is \u201c an apostate from the faith of his fathers , \u201d eagerly desires to see what will happen to him in such surroundings as those made clear in Act I . In the earlier version , a reader learns that there are mysteries which the play will probably solve , but has nothing on which to focus his attention as a compelling element of suspense . Any one knows that when an actor fails to come on at the right moment , unless quick-witted actors invent dialogue or action , the stage \u201c waits \u201d for the actor . There is something which exactly corresponds to this in the text of plays . Henry Le Barren comes to call on Madge Ellsworth . The maid , after showing him into the library , goes to find her mistress . \u201c Meanwhile Henry looks idly at the books on the table till Madge enters . \u201d Unless Madge , perfectly sure that Henry would call at this hour , is waiting just outside the door , some action is needed on the stage to cover the time space until she can enter naturally . It is true that looking at the books fills the time for Henry , but it does not sustain for the audience interest already created in him or the story . When nothing is taking place on the stage , something is taking place in the audience which greatly concerns the dramatist : it is slipping away from him because it is losing interest . For contrast , suppose that Henry sits restlessly only a moment , then with a sigh picks up a book , tries to read , falls to dreaming , and holds the book so that we may see he is reading it upside down . He tries another book in vain . He starts three or four times , thinking that the door is about to open . He absent-mindedly examines a piece of bric-a-brac . He starts forward eagerly the moment Madge enters . Now we are interested , because he is either exhibiting emotions the cause of which we understand , emotions which lead us to expect an interesting scene between him and Madge , or his conduct sets us guessing as to what can lie ahead between the two . In the first illustration , the play lacks movement ; in the second , commonplace as it is , the movement does not cease . At times it helps suspense not only to shift the order of details but to separate two elements of suspense , treating them separately in well correlated groups . In Hamlet , Q1 , the soliloquy , \u201c To be , or not to be \u201d precedes the meeting of Ophelia and Hamlet , part of Hamlet 's tricking of Polonius , and the coming of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern . The greater part of the befuddling of Polonius then follows . The players enter and plan with Hamlet the performance of The Mousetrap . Hamlet , left alone , bursts into the soliloquy , \u201c Why what a dunghill idiot slave am I ! \u201d Q2 rearranges thus : Polonius and Hamlet ; Rosencrantz and Guildenstern ; Polonius returning to announce the players ; the planning for The Mousetrap ; Hamlet left alone crying , \u201c Oh what a rogue and peasant 's slave am I ! \u201d Here all the details bearing on the play are gathered together . Next come the King and Queen with their plot to try out Hamlet by means of Ophelia . The soliloquy , \u201c To be , or not to be \u201d follows this . Then Hamlet and Ophelia have the scene \u201c To a nunnery go ! \u201d Instead of jumbling two elements of suspense ,\u2014 probable results of the play planned by Hamlet and of the Ophelia-Hamlet interest ,\u2014 each is given added suspense by separate treatment . In Q1 , as we shift from one to the other , each weakens the other or is momentarily blocked by it . Rearranged , the very order of the details in each part makes not only for clearer but stronger suspense .Today a plot made up of two or three but slightly related stories is far less popular than in the days of Queen Elizabeth . Our public demands that such stories shall be so correlated within the play as to be mutually helpful . This desire results not from innate niceness of feeling for unity of design but from dislike of a distribution of interests which interferes with the suspense each story creates . Though it is , of course , possible perfectly to maintain suspense in plays of interwoven plots \u2014 the plays of Shakespeare and many writers since prove this \u2014 it is far more difficult than maintaining suspense in a play of single plot . Quite possibly this is the chief reason for the great popularity today of plays of single plot : they are both easier to follow and easier to write . A related fault which interferes with suspense is the \u201c stage wait \u201d treated on page 209 . As has also been pointed out , there is danger in transitional scenes meant to cover a time space or to shift the interest of an audience . If they accomplish either purpose and do not advance the plot , they really fail . Bulwer-Lytton met this difficulty in writing Money : I think in the first 3 acts you will find little to alter . But in Act 4 \u2014 the 2 scene with Lady B . & Clara \u2014& Joke & the Tradesman do n't help on the Plot much \u2014 they were wanted , however , especially the last to give time for change of dress & smooth the lapse of the theme from money to dinner ; you will see if this part requires any amendment .Also exposition , undoubtedly necessary but delayed too long , may so clog an act as to weaken or kill it . In a play set in what was once a fashionable dining-room , but is now the fitting-room of a dressmaker , the scene is not placed for some time . Finally , a figure entering makes clear the supposed setting , but for this the action on stage has to be broken off . The increasing popularity of a play of three or four acts as compared with five has almost wholly done away with another destroyer of suspense \u2014 the explanatory and adjusting last act . In it , intelligent auditors who knew from the close of the fourth act how the story must end were expected to watch with interest final disposition of the characters . Dramatists of the eighties and nineties turned from this use slowly . For proof examine the last act of The Hypocrites , by H. A. Jones , in other respects a play well away from the older methods of technique . Now , both the older and the younger generation of dramatists expect to carry suspense as near the end of the play as they possibly can . Letting an audience anticipate something of the end of a play is all very well , but when it foresees just what is going to happen and has no farther interest , except to learn whether it happens exactly as anticipated , suspense and even attention cease . In that case an audience begins to gather its belongings for departure . Something held back which cannot surely be anticipated is the very basis of suspense . It follows from what has just been said that there can never be perfect suspense when the plot ends an act or more before the final curtain . It is vain to try to start new interests in order to create fresh suspense . Unless the latter part of a play grows out of the first , at least as much as the Perdita-Florizel story grows out of that of Leontes and Hermione , there can be no good suspense . When it seems necessary to tack on new material because all suspense is ended , do not add : rewrite . It has often been said that surprise \u2014 springing something unexpectedly upon an audience \u2014 is better than suspense . Lessing said of the comparative value of surprise and suspense : For one instance where it is useful to conceal from the spectator an important event until it has taken place there are ten and more where interest demands the very contrary . By means of secrecy a poet effects a short surprise , but in what enduring disquietude could he have maintained us if he had made no secret about it ! Whoever is struck down in a moment , I can only pity for a moment . But how if I expect the blow , how if I see the storm brewing and threatening for some time about my head or his ? For my part none of the personages need know each other if only the spectator knows them all . Nay I would even maintain that the subject which requires such secrecy is a thankless subject , that the plot in which we have to make recourse to it is not as good as that in which we could have done without it . It will never give occasion for anything great . We shall be obliged to occupy ourselves with preparations that are either too dark or too clear , the whole poem becomes a collection of little artistic tricks by means of which we effect nothing more than a short surprise . If on the contrary everything that concerns the personages is known , I see in this knowledge the source of the most violent emotions . Why have certain monologues such a great effect ? Because they acquaint me with the secret intentions of the speaker and this confidence at once fills me with hope or fear . If the condition of the personages is unknown , the spectator cannot interest himself more vividly in the action than the personages . But the interest would be doubled for the spectator if light is thrown on the matter , and he feels that action and speech would be quite otherwise if the personages knew one another . Only then I shall scarcely be able to await what is to become of them when I am able to compare that which they really are with that which they do or would do .Look at the quotation from the First Part of Henry VI on Pp . 97-100 . Talbot whispers to the Captain , and leaves us guessing what he means to do at his meeting with the Countess of Auvergne . In like manner the Countess merely refers to the plot she has laid with her Porter . We never know just what was the plan of the Countess . We get only a momentary sensation , surprise , when Talbot 's soldiers force their way in . Suppose we had been allowed to know the plans of the Countess , and they had seemed very dangerous for Talbot . Then , as she played with him , sure of her position , there would have been more suspense than in Shakespeare 's text , because an audience would have been wondering , not merely \u201c What is the blow Talbot will strike ? \u201d but \u201c Can any blow he will strike overcome the seemingly effective plans of the Countess ? \u201d Suppose we had been allowed to know the plans of both . Then , as we watched the Countess playing her scheme off against the plan of Talbot , of which she would be unaware , might there not easily be even more suspense ? At every turn of their dialogue we should be wondering : \u201c Why does not Talbot strike now ? Can he save the situation , if he delays ? With all this against him , can he save it in any case ? \u201d In the use of surprise , the dramatist depends almost entirely on his situation . Suspense permits him to elaborate his situation by means of the characters in it . In other words , surprise is situation , suspense is characterization . On this matter recent words of William Archer seem final : Curiosityis the accidental relish of a single night ; whereas the essential and abiding pleasure of the theatre lies in foreknowledge . In relation to the characters of the drama , the audience are as gods looking before and after . Sitting in the theatre , we taste , for a moment , the glory of omniscience . With vision unsealed , we watch the gropings of purblind mortals after happiness and smile at their stumblings , their blunders , their futile quests , their misplaced exultations , their groundless panics . To keep a secret from us is to reduce us to their level , and deprive us of our clairvoyant aloofness . There may be a pleasure in that too ; we may join with zest in the game of blind-man'shYpppHeNbuff ; but the theatre is in its essence a place where we are privileged to take off the bandage we wear in daily life , and to contemplate , with laughter or with tears , the blindfold gambols of our neighbors .What is basal in suspense is , of course , that an audience shall feel for some person or persons of the play just the degree of sympathy the dramatist desires . Unless their sympathy is as keen as his , the scene must fall short emotionally . For instance , in a play produced some years ago author and actors expected the audience to sympathize throughout with a mother . At the climax of one of the acts she was left on-stage in an agonized state of mind because her husband , who hates her illegitimate child , has left the stage with threats to kill it . The actress wrote of the first night : \u201c In that scene I might as well have recited the alphabet for all the audience cared for my emotion . Their sympathy made them live , not with me , but with the defenceless child who at any moment might be murdered off-stage by the cruel father . \u201d Suspense for the audience there certainly was , but not of the kind intended . It was necessary to rewrite the scene . Evidently , what happens off-stage may , by its greater interest for the audience , kill the effect of what is passing on-stage . What the dramatist dares not try to represent on-stage because of its mechanical difficulty or horror , he tries to carry off by vivid and even terrifying description . By making the audience see the off-stage action through the eyes of the person most affected , or by portraying vividly his emotions when another describes the action to him , dramatists endeavor to lose none of their desired suspense . The point to remember is that the moment the off-stage action becomes of more importance than the emotions caused by that action for persons on-stage , the real centre of interest has been shifted , the desired suspense is gone , and the scene must be rewritten . Suspense in a play is rightly handled , then , when it is promptly created to the extent desired by the dramatist ; carries on with increasing intensity from act to act ; and reaches its climax at or just before the final curtain . Climax is , therefore , an integral part of suspense . The point of greatest intensity reached in an incident , scene , act , or play is the moment of climax . Climax is not the result of theory but comes from long observation of audiences . A scene or act which breaks off or declines in interest towards its close never delights an audience as does a scene or act which closes with its strongest emotional effect . Look at the ending of The Troublesome Raigne of King John , Part I . Though King John declares himself \u201c the joyfulst man alive , \u201d the audience does not so sympathize with him that his delight is a fitting climax to the play . Rather do they so keenly sympathize with Prince Arthur and even the lords who have been outraged by Arthur 's proposed death that they want to know more of him and them .", "Come .The second act at Colonel Knowlton 's house closes on Hale 's decision to serve his country as a spy :"]}, "act_index": 6, "play_index": 6}, {"data": {"349": ["No !This is the close of Act III .", "It will make me a soldier 's sweetheart !", "Fitzroy will be back .

Does this sound like an individual woman or like the author using one of his characters for the sounding phrases of his own thinking ? In the next illustration , from George Barnwell , the colorlessness comes from the lack of quickening sympathy with character which marks most of Lillo 's work .", "Call my coffee poison , will ye ?

That I were out of this sorrow so strong !The writer of the Hegge speech had discovered long before Ralph Waldo Emerson that the secret of good dialogue is \u201c truth carried alive into the heart by passion . \u201d The second requisite , then , of good dialogue is that it must be kindled by feeling , made alive by the emotion of the speaker . For the would-be dramatist the secret is so to know his characters that facts are not mere facts , but conditions moving him because they move the characters he perfectly understands . As he interprets between character and audience , he must be like Planchette or the clairvoyant , the creature of another 's will , whose ideas and emotions rather than his own he tries with all the power that is in him to convey . In brief , then , though it is absolutely necessary that dialogue give the facts as to what happens , who the people are , their relations to one another , etc ., it is better dialogue if , while doing all this , it seems to be busied only with characterization . Unassigned dialogue usually makes a reader or hearer promptly recognize his preference for characterized rather than uncharacterized speech . When a group , as in many stage mobs , speaks in chorus , or at best in sections , the result is unreality for many hearers and absurdity for the more critical . Every hearer knows that people do not really , when part of a mob , say absolutely the same thing , and rarely speak in perfect unison . Common sense cries out for individualization among the possible speakers . When we read the following extract from Andreiev 's Life of Man , we may agree with what is apparently the author 's idea , that it makes no difference which one of the speakers delivers a particular line or sentence ; but the moment the scene is staged everything changes .

Husband !It is of course true , as M. Brieux maintains in regard to the two endings of his early play , Blanchette ,that sometimes more than one ending may be made plausible . Consequently he changed a tragic close to something more pleasing to his audience . Belief grows , however , that when a play has been begun and developed with a tragic ending in mind , this cannot with entire convincingness be changed to something else unless the play is rewritten from the start . There is inevitableness in the conduct on the stage of the creatures of our brains even as with people of real life . So strongly does Sir Arthur Pinero feel this as the result of his long experience that , though he changed the ending of The Big Drum in 1915 in accordance with public demand , he restored the original version when printing the play . He says in his Preface : The Big Drum is published exactly as it was written , and as it was originally performed . At its first representation , however , the audience was reported to have been saddened by its \u201c unhappy ending . \u201d Pressure was forthwith put upon me to reconcile Philip and Ottoline at the finish , and at the third performance of the play the curtain fell upon the picture , violently and crudely brought about , of Ottoline in Philip 's arms . I made the alteration against my principles and against my conscience , and yet not altogether unwillingly . For we live in depressing times ; and perhaps in such times it is the first duty of a writer for the stage to make concessions to his audience and , above everything , to try to afford them a complete , if brief , distraction from the gloom which awaits them outside the theatre . My excuse for having at the start provided an \u201c unhappy \u201d ending is that I was blind enough not to regard the ultimate break between Philip and Ottoline as really unhappy for either party . On the contrary , I looked upon the separation of these two people as a fortunate occurrence for them both ; and I conceive it as a piece of ironic comedy which might not prove unentertaining that the falling away of Philip from his high resolves was checked by the woman he had once despised and who had at last grown to know and to despise herself . But comedy of this order has a knack of cutting rather deeply , of ceasing , in some minds , to be comedy at all ; and it may be said that this is what has happened in the present instance . Luckily it is equally true that certain matters are less painful , because less actual , in print than upon the stage . The \u201c wicked publisher \u201d therefore , even when bombs are dropping round him , can afford to be more independent than the theatrical manager ; and for this reason I have not hesitated to ask my friend Mr. Heinemann to publish The Big Drum in its original form .What Ibsen thought of the ultimate effect of changing an ending to accord with public sentiment , these words about A Doll 's House show : At the time when A Doll 's House was quite new , I was obliged to give my consent to an alteration of the last scene for Frau Hedwig Niemann-Raabe , who was to play the part of Nora in Berlin . At that time I had no choice . I was entirely unprotected by copyright law in Germany , and could , consequently , prevent nothing . Besides , the play in its original , uncorrupted form was accessible to the German public in a German edition which was already printed and published . With its altered ending it had only a short run . In its unchanged form it is still being played .Dumas fils was even more severe in his strictures : If at the second performance you are ready to modify your central idea , your development or your conclusion to please the public whom the night before you were pretending to teach something fresh , you may be , perhaps , an ingenious worker in the theatre , an adroit impresario , a facile inventor ; you will never be a dramatist . You can make mistakes in details of execution ; you have no right to make a mistake in the logic of your play , its correlations of emotions and acts , and least of all , in their outcome .Characterization , then , should be watched carefully in its fundamentals , all changes , and especially for its logical outcome . Long ago , Diderot summed up the subject thus : One can form an infinitude of plans on the same subject and developed around the same characters . But the characters being once settled , they can have but one manner of speaking . Your figures will have this or that to say according to the situation in which you may have placed them , but being the same human beings in all the situations , they will not , fundamentally , contradict themselves .How may we know whether our motivation is good or not ? First of all , it must be clear . If an audience cannot make out why one of our characters does what he is doing , from that moment the play weakens . It is on this ground that William Archer objected to the Becket of Tennyson : \u201c Some gents , \u201d says the keeper , in Punch , to the unsuccessful sportsman , \u201c goes a-wingin \u2019 and a-worritin \u2019 the poor birds ; but you , sir \u2014 you misses \u2018 em clane and nate ! \u201d With the like delicate tact criticism can only compliment the poet on the \u201c clane and nate \u201d way in which he has missed the historical interest , the psychological problem , of his theme . What was it that converted the Becket of Toulouse into the Becket of Clarendon \u2014 the splendid warrior-diplomatist into the austere prelate ? The cowl , we are told , does not make the monk ; but in Lord Tennyson 's psychology it seems that it does . Of the process of thought , the development of feeling , which leads Becket , on assuming the tonsure , to break with the traditions of his career , with the friend of his heart and with his own worldly interest \u2014 of all this we have no hint . The social and political issues involved are left equally in the vague . Of the two contending forces , the Church and the Crown , which makes for good , and which for evil ? With which ought we to sympathize ? It might be argued that we have no right to ask this question , and that it is precisely a proof of the poet 's art that he holds the balance evenly , and does not write as a partisan . But as a matter of fact this is not so . The poet is not impartial ; he is only indefinite . We are evidently intended to sympathize , and we do sympathize , with Becket , simply because we feel that he is staking his life on a principle ; but what that principle precisely is , and what its bearings on history and civilization , we are left to find out for ourselves . Thus the intellectual opportunity , if I may call it so , is missed \u201c clane and nate . \u201dContrast the third , fourth , and fifth acts of Michael and His Lost Angelwith the first and second . So admirable is the characterization of Acts I and II that a reader understands exactly what Audrie and Michael are doing and why . In the other acts , though what they are doing is clear , why the Audrie and Michael of the first two acts behaved thus is by no means clear and plausible . Indeed , plausibility and clearness go hand in hand as tests of motivation . Accounting for the deeds of any particular character is easy if the conduct rests on motives which any audience will immediately recognize as both widespread and likely to produce the situation . It is just here , however , that national taste and literary convention complicate the work of the dramatist . An American , watching a performance of Simoneby M. Brieux , hardly understood the loud protests which burst from the audience when the heroine , at the end of the play , sternly denounced her father 's conduct . To him , it seemed quite natural that an American girl should assume this right of individual judgment . The French audience felt that a French girl , because of her training , would not , under the circumstances , thus attack her father . M. Brieux admitted himself wrong and changed the ending . It is this fact , that conduct plausible for one nation is not always equally plausible for another , which makes it hard for an American public to understand a goodly number of the masterpieces of recent Continental dramatic literature . What literary convention may do in twisting conduct from the normal , the pseudo-classic French drama of Corneille and Racine , and its foster child , the Heroic Drama of England , illustrate . Dryden himself points out clearly the extent to which momentary convention among the French deflected the characters in their tragedies from the normal : The French poets ... would not , for example , have suffer 'd Cleopatra and Octavia to have met ; or , if they had met , there must only have passed betwixt them some cold civilities , but no eagerness of repartee , for fear of offending against the greatness of their characters , and the modesty of their sex . This objection I foresaw , and at the same time contemn 'd ; for I judg 'd it both natural and probable that Octavia , proud of her new-gain 'd conquest , would search out Cleopatra to triumph over her ; and that Cleopatra , thus attack 'd , was not of a spirit to shun the encounter : and \u2018 tis not unlikely that two exasperated rivals should use such satire as I have put into their mouths ; for , after all , tho \u2019 the one were a Roman , and the other a queen , they were both women . Thus , their Hippolytus is so scrupulous in point of decency that he will rather expose himself to death than accuse his stepmother to his father ; and my critics I am sure will commend him for it : but we of grosser apprehensions are apt to think that this excess of generosity is not practicable , but with fools and madmen . This was good manners with a vengeance ; and the audience is like to be much concern 'd at the misfortunes of this admirable hero ; but take Hippolytus out of his poetic fit , and I suppose he would think it a wiser part to set the saddle on the right horse , and choose rather to live with the reputation of a plain-spoken , honest man , than to die with the infamy of an incestuous villain . In the meantime we may take notice that where the poet ought to have preserv 'd the character as it was deliver 'd to us by antiquity , when he should have given us the picture of a rough young man , of the Amazonian strain , a jolly huntsman , and both by his profession and his early rising a mortal enemy to love , he has chosen to give him the turn of gallantry , sent him to travel from Athens to Paris , taught him to make love , and transformed the Hippolytus of Euripides into Monsieur Hippolyte .One of the chief elements in the genius of Shakespeare is his power to transcend momentary conventions , fads , and theories , and to discern in his material , whether history or fiction , eternal principles of conduct . Thus he wrote for all men and for all time . In Love 's Labor 's Lost he wrote for a special audience , appealing to its ideas of style and humor . In Twelfth Night he let his characters have full sway . Which is the more alive today ? Nor is it only the literary conventions of an audience which affect the problem of plausibility set an author . The French public of 1841 which came to the five-act play of Eugene Scribe , Une Chaine ,asked , not a convincing picture of life , but mere entertainment . Therefore they accepted insufficient motivation and artificiality in handling the scenes . Louise , the wife , discovering from words of her husband as she enters the room that her former lover , Emmeric , now prefers Aline to her , sits down and dashes off a signed letter releasing him . Just why is not clear . In order that she may do this writing unobserved of her husband , two characters must , for some time , be so managed as to stand between him and her . In order that the husband may never know she has been in love with Emmeric , the letter must be kept out of his hands , and read only by the guardian of Aline , Clerambeau . All this requires constant artifice . Sidney Grundy made a one-act adaptation of Une Chaine called In Honor Bound .In this , Lady Carlyon , waking from sleep on the divan in her husband 's study , hears , unobserved by Philip and Sir George , the young man 's admission that he no longer cares for her . When her cry reveals her , Sir George , her husband , thinking her unwell , goes to bring her niece , Rose , to her aid . Lady Carlyon learns promptly from Philip that the guardian of the girl he is engaged to demands a letter releasing him from any former entanglement . Lady Carlyon , to cover her chagrin , with seeming willingness writes and signs a letter . Thus the writing takes place when the husband is off stage , and the evident chagrin of Lady Carlyon motivates it better . The relation of the husband to the letter is also handled better than in the original . He , unlike St. Geran , strongly suspects that his wife has cared for the younger man . Lady Carlyon is unaware that Sir George is the guardian in question and that the girl is her niece , Rose . Consequently she lets slip that Philip possesses the desired letter . Sir George demands it as his right , noting her disturbance when she learns that her husband is involved in the situation . When Philip refuses to surrender the letter , Sir George courteously permits him to read it aloud . Just before the signature is reached , he stops Philip , asking him if the letter is signed . When Philip admits that it is , Sir George insists on having the letter , then , without looking at it , burns it at the lamp with words of sympathy for the writer . All this turns the husband in this scene from a mere lay figure into a character , and greatly lessens the artificiality of the original . By means of better characterization a motivation fundamentally more plausible is provided . Why ? Because an English audience of 1880-90 expected much more probability in a play than did a French or English audience of 1841 . Of course , conduct initially unconvincing may be so treated as to become entirely satisfactory . One of the delights in characterization is so preparing for an exhibition of character likely to seem unreal of itself that when it is presented it is accepted either at once or before the scene closes . Any motive which a dramatist can make acceptable to his audience is ultimately just as good as one accepted unquestioningly . Shylock 's demand for the pound of flesh is in itself unplausible enough \u2014 the act of one demented or insane . But Shakespeare 's emphasis on his racial hate lends it possibility . His presentation of the other people in the play as accepting the bond with the minimum of question makes it seem probable . If a would-be dramatist were to rule out as material not to be treated whatever at the outset seems improbable or impossible , think what our drama would lose : such plays as Faust , Midsummer Night 's Dream , The Blue Bird , and even Hamlet . Repeatedly in treating plausibility it has been implied or stated that what is said or done must be \u201c in character . \u201d This suggests another test of good motivation . What happens must be plausible , not only in that it accords with known human experience , but with what has been done by the character in preceding portions of the play . In The Masqueraders , when Sir Brice and David stake Dulcie and her child against the fortune of the latter , and let all turn upon a game of cards , a reader is skeptical , for even if it be admitted that Sir Brice might do this , it does not accord with what we know of David from the earlier scenes of the play .", "No ."]}, "act_index": 6, "play_index": 6}, {"data": {"377": ["Simple cutting ?", "And I say you shall .", "But I owe you six thousand pounds .

It is by well-motived characterization that drama passes from melodrama to story-play and so to tragedy ; or , from the broadest farce or extravaganza through low comedy to high . As long as we care little what the people in our play are , and greatly for comic or serious happenings , we may string situations together almost at will . The moment that our figures come alive , as has been pointed out , selection in our possible material has begun . Some of the incidents in our melodrama or broad farce will drop out as wholly impossible for these figures which have come to life . Others must be modified if the figures are to take part in them . Give a melodrama sustaining , convincing characterization and it must at least turn into a story-play , something which after a mingling of the serious and the comic does not end tragically . So characterize in a story with a serious ending that the tragic result develops inevitably from the sequence of preceding scenes , and tragedy is born . Watch the way in which Shakespeare lifts the Hubert and Arthur scene of the old play of King John by the infused characterization . In the old play the author presents us with puppets depending for their effect on the contained horror of the scene . Shakespeare creates a winsome , brave young prince , and a very human Hubert . The scene moves us , not , simply from our dread of physical torture , but because of our growing intense sympathy for the lad who is fighting for his life .", "The reason why I would not suffer these", "I may with better privacy convay", "He dies ."]}, "act_index": 6, "play_index": 6}, {"data": {"380": ["Good morrow , little prince ."]}, "act_index": 6, "play_index": 6}, {"data": {"381": ["Alas , thou wrongst my Hub .

A recently published play prefaces not only every speech , but even parts of the speeches with careful statements as to how they should be given , even when the text is perfectly clear . Nothing is left to the imagination , and the text is often emotionally colorless . Let it be remembered , then , that the stage direction is not a pocket into which a dramatist may stuff whatever explanation , description , or analysis a novelist might allow himself , but is more a last resort to which he turns when he cannot make his text convey all that is necessary . The passing of the soliloquy and the asidemakes the dramatist of today much more limited than were his predecessors in letting a character describe itself . Today everything depends on the naturalness of the self-exposition . The vainglorious , the self-centered , the garrulous will always talk of themselves freely . The reserved , the timid , and persons under suspicion will be sparing of words . When the ingenuity of the dramatist cannot make self-exposition plausible , the scene promptly becomes unreal . The point to be remembered is , as George Meredith once said , that \u201c The verdict is with the observer . \u201d Not what seems plausible to the author but what , as he tries it on auditors , proves acceptable , may stand .

In the old play the murderers merely enter and go out again as ordered . In Shakespeare they enter at the moment which makes them the climactic touch in the terror of Arthur and the audience . When Hubert orders them to go , it is the first sign that he may relent . The inexperienced dramatist is almost always wasteful in the number of characters used . An adaptation of a Spanish story called for a cast of about a dozen important figures and some sixty supernumeraries as soldiers and peasants \u2014 all this in a one-act play . It meant very little labor to cut the soldiery to a few officers and some privates , and the peasantry to some six or eight people . Ultimately , the total cast did not contain a quarter as many people as the original , yet nothing important had been lost . Rewriting a play often is , and should be , a \u201c slaughter of the innocents . \u201d Do n't use unneeded people . You must provide them with dialogue , and as the play goes on , some justification for existence . The manager must pay them salaries . First of all , get rid of entirely unnecessary people . They usually hold over from the story as originally heard or read . For instance , a recent adaptation used from the original story a blinking dwarf sitting silent , forever watchful , at a table in the restaurant where the story was placed . His smile simply emphasized the cynicism of the story enacted in his sight . He was in no way necessary to the telling of the story ,\u2014 and so he disappeared in the final form of the play . One is constantly tempted to bring in some figure for purposes of easy exposition only to find that one must either bind him in with the story as it develops , or drop him out of sight the moment his expository work is done . The trouble with such figures is that they are likely to give false clues , stirring a hearer to interest in them or their apparent relation to the story , when nothing is to come of one or the other . Usually a little patience and ingenuity will give this needed exposition to some character or characters essential to the plot . In a recent play of Breton life during the Chouan War , an attractive peasant boy was introduced in order to plant in the minds of the audience certain ideas as to immediate conditions of the war , and the relation of the woman to whom he is talking with the Prince , his leader . Wishing to show the devotion of the Prince 's followers , the author had the boy talk much of his own loyalty to his leader . Just there was the false clue . Every auditor expected his loyalty to lead to something later in the play ; but the youth , having told his tale , disappeared for good . It took very little time to discover that all the young man told could perfectly well be made clear in one preceding scene between the woman and her son , and two of the other scenes immediately following , between the woman and the young Prince . It is these unnecessary figures who are largely responsible for the scenes already spoken of in chapter IV which clog the movement of a play . Sometimes , too , similar figures at different places in a play do exactly or nearly the same work ,\u2014 servants for instance . When it does not interfere with verisimilitude , give the tasks to one person rather than two , or two rather than three . That is , use only people absolutely needed . Sometimes these carelessly introduced figures stray through a play like an unquiet spirit . In The Road to Happiness one character , Porter , was of so little importance that most of the time , when on the stage , he had nothing to do . When really acting , it was largely in pantomime , or with speech that , not effectively , reiterated what some one else was saying . He existed really for two scenes . In the first act he might just as well have been talked about as shown , and in the second act what he did could well have been done by one of the other important characters . When any character in a play shows a tendency not to get into the action readily ; when for long periods he is easily overlooked by the author ; it is time to consider whether he should not be given the coup de grace . Today we are fortunately departing from an idea somewhat prevalent in the middle of the nineteenth century , that a figure once introduced into a play should be kept there until the final curtain . That is exalting technique , and the so-called \u201c well-made \u201d play , above truth to life . When a character is doing needed work , use him when and as long as he would appear in real life , and no longer . Use each character for a purpose , and when it is fulfilled , drop him . Naturalness and theatrical economy are the two tests : the greater of these is naturalness . All that has been said comes to this . Know your characters so intimately that you can move , think , and feel with them , supplied by them with far more material than you can use in any one play . See that they are properly introduced to the audience ; that they are clearly and convincingly presented . Do not forget the importance of entrances and exits . Cut out all unnecessary figures . There follow three bits of characterization from very different types of play : Sir John Vanbrugh 's The Provoked Wife , a comedy of manners ; G. B. Shaw 's farce-comedy , You Never Can Tell ; and Eugene Brieux 's thesis play , The Cradle . The first scene aims merely to present vividly the riotous and drunken squire . The second , while characterizing William , aims to illustrate that contentment lies in doing that to which one is accustomed , under accustomed conditions . The third not only characterizes ; it shows that no law of man can wholly give a woman to a second husband when common anxiety with the first husband for the child of their marriage draws them together . Note in all three the use of action as compared with description or analysis ; the connotative value of the phrasings ; the succint sureness . THE PROVOKED WIFE", "Roche .

Everything in this well-written beginning of an interesting play depends on bringing to the delivery of the lines right use of the dramatist 's greatest aids : gesture , facial expression , pantomime , and above all the exquisite intonations of which the human voice is capable . Write this scene as a novelist would handle it , and see to what different proportions it will swell . Note in the final result how much less connotative , how much more commonplace the dialogue probably is . Contrasting two passages \u2014 one from a novel , the other in a play drawn from it \u2014 will perhaps best illustrate that the dialogue of the novel and of the play treating the same story usually differ greatly . And when it became clear that somebody , good or bad , was without , Patty , having regard to the lateness of the hour and the probability of supernatural visitations , was much disposed to make as though the knocking were unheard , and to creep quietly off to bed . But Mistress Beatrice prevailed upon her to depart from this prudent course ; and the two peered from an upper window to see who stood before the door . At first they could see no one ; but presently a little figure stepped back from the shadow , looking up to the window above , and Beatrice Cope , although she discerned not the face , felt more than ever certain that this summons was for her . \u201c \u2018 Tis but a child there without , Patty , \u201d she said . \u201c Maybe \u2018 tis some poor little creature that has lost its way , and come here for help and shelter . Heaven forbid that we should leave it to wander about , all the dreary night through ! \u201d Patty 's fears were not much calmed by the sight of this lonely child . \u201c \u2018 Twas the Phantom Child , \u201d she murmured , \u201c who comes wailing piteously to honest folks \u2019 doors o \u2019 nights ; and if they take it in and cherish it , it works them grievous woe . \u201d Mistress Beatrice , however , tried to hear as little as she might of what Patty was saying ; and she went downstairs and undid the heavy bar very cautiously . Then she opened the door a little space ; and Patty Joyce stood by her staunchly , although disapproving of what she did . And when the door was opened , this persevering applicant proved to be only the boy Bill Lampeter , who was known at White-oaks as at Crowe Hall , and a score of country Granges beside . He did but crave a drink of milk and a bit to eat , he said . He had been a-foot all day , and had had nought to eat ; and seeing a light burning in the houseplace , he made bold to knock and ask for what he needed . The boy 's breath was short and hurried , and his grimy face was pale and damp with toil of hard running . He did not seek to enter , but kept glancing over his shoulder into the darkness behind him . Beatrice sent Patty for food and drink , standing still herself in the doorway ; and the maid was no sooner gone than the boy drew nearer and spoke . \u201c Oh , mistress , \u201d he said , hoarsely , \u201c I have been beat to-night \u2014 but I told \u2018 em nought . The corporal he raddled my bones terrible \u2014 but I set my teeth , and I told \u2018 un nought . I bit him when he took they shining white things o \u2019 yourn , wi \u2019 the writing ; them as I could not give to Mr . Cope , the day I warned the porter at Goodrest that the red-coats was upon \u2018 em . I had the white things safe , mistress , hid in my smock \u201d \u2014\u2014 \u201c And I would ha \u2019 giv \u2019 them to Mr . Cope , the first chance I got \u2014 I would , honest and true . But the scouting party caught me ; and they says , \u2018 Thee be allays running from one Grange to another , thee little ne'erhYpppHeNdohYpppHeNweel ; thee can tell us what we wants to know about Goodrest in the hills \u2019 \u2014 And I was telling of \u2018 em just what tales comed into my head , for fear of unpleasantness , mistress , when the corporal , a great rough chap , seizes hold of me , and says , says he , \u2018'Tis all a pack o \u2019 lies , this here . Search him , \u2019 he says , \u2018 and see if he carries messages or tokens . \u2019 And then I fought and bit , for I know 'd they 'd find your bright things in my smock ; and I bit his hand nigh upon through , that I did , \u201d said Bill , with grim satisfaction , and an oath at which poor Beatrice shuddered . \u201c Oh , hush ! \u201d she said . \u201c There is no help in swearing , boy . \u201d \u201c He swore , \u201d Bill replied . \u201c But when he got the tablets , he were fine and pleased . And he said , \u2018 This is a stag of ten , my boys ; and should he snuff the breeze too soon we have means to keep him where he is till morning . Hold that little viper fast , \u2019 says he ,' and for your lives do n't let him give us the slip . \u2019 \u2014 So one of the troopers took me behind him on his horse , with a rope round my body , drawn cruel tight at first . And I panted and groaned , and made as though he were killing of me ; and after a bit he slacked the rope a little , so as I could put my head down and gnaw it through in the dark . And at the dip of a valley , where the shadow was deep under the trees , I slipped off quiet-like into the long grass . He knew the rope was loose in a minute , and he snapped his pistol ; but the covert was good , and I crope into the heart of a holler tree covered o'er wi \u2019 ivy . I bided there , till they was tired o \u2019 hunting round .\u2014 But oh , mistress , the poor gentleman at Goodrest is undone !\u2014 They talked together while the trooper was making me fast upon his horse ; and I heard a word now and again , for I listened with all my might . There were but four of \u2018 em ; and they said they were n't strong enough to surprise Goodrest , but must ride back to quarters for help . And as we went past Grantford Farm , the corporal called a halt ; and one held his horse while he went in and spoke with the farmer . And , mistress , Hugh Stone of Grantford is known for a bitter Whig . ... And presently Hugh of Grantford comes out , and his little brother with him ; and the boy had that as you wrote upon \u2014 that as they took from me \u2014 in his hand . And the corporal says , looking over his shoulder quick and short , \u2018 Does he understand ? \u2019 says he . \u2018 Oh , aye , \u2019 says Hugh of Grantford , \u2018 he understands fine . \u2019 And I could see wee Jock did not like the job he were put upon ; and I made a face at him from ahint the trooper 's back , and he liked it less nor ever then . \u201d \u201c What job , Bill ? \u201d Bill Lampeter looked in amazement at this beautiful , terrified lady , who did not understand . \u201c Do n't \u2018 ee see ? \u201d he said . \u201c Jock o \u2019 Grantford were to take your writing to Goodrest , and play upon the gentleman there , to keep him biding till the red-coats come . What were it as you wrote down that day , mistress ? \u201d As in a flash of painful memory Beatrice saw the dainty tablets once more , with words traced upon them in a hand rendered somewhat unsteady by the slow pace of the sorrel horse \u2014 a hand unmistakable , however , to the eyes of Charlie Cope . I pray you , do not stir far from home . There is risk abroad . B. C . She understood then ; and she turned quickly to Patty Joyce , who had come back bringing bread and milk ere Bill 's tale was half done . Bill , even in the eagerness of his disclosure , had clutched the bread and cheese ; and now he drained the mug of milk , while the good-natured maid stood open-mouthed , her eyes fixed upon Mistress Beatrice . \u201c Patty , \u201d the young lady whispered , \u201c I think you are faithful and true .... I must trust you with a perilous secret . This gentleman whom they seek at Goodrest is my only brother ; he has papers of importance in his keeping , and a warrant is out for his arrest . They will lure him to his destruction by means of me , his sister ; he knows my handwriting and will trust to my warning . He will lie close at Goodrest , as a hare upon her form ; and they will take him \u2014 oh ! they will take him prisoner !\u2014 ere morning dawns . I must to Goodrest now , in the dark night .\u2014 Boy ! is there time ? is there time ? \u201d Bill Lampeter nodded , munching his bread . \u201c They 'll not be back afore the dawning , them troopers , \u201d he said . \u201c They 've limed the twig , ye see ; the bird is made fast . If Mr . Cope do hear the country 's up , he 'll bide where he be there at Goodrest , reckoning \u2018 tis safest to keep still . Between now and the first streak as shows over the Black Scaur , mistress , you can do as you will . \u201d \u201c Eh , Mistress Beatrice , you can n't never go , \u201d said Patty , trembling . \u201c You could n't dare to do it . And this here boy , \u201d she whispered , standing close to Mistress Beatrice , \u201c is a very proverb for wicked story-telling . \u2018 Tis a naughty little varlet ; who knows that he has not been set on to bring this tale ? \u201d \u201c \u2018 Tis true enough , though I be a story-teller , \u201d said Bill , whose ears were sharp . \u201c Yon gentleman at Goodrest has need of thee the night , mistress . And now let me lie down on the straw in the big barn , for my bones do ache , and I be dizzy wi \u2019 running . \u201d He caught at the doorpost as he spoke ; and Patty Joyce 's suspicion vanished in pity for the worn-out creature . She kindled a flame to light the lanthorn which hung in the houseplace ; and herself crossed the wide courtyard to make Bill a comfortable resting-place in the soft hay and clean straw which filled the great barn .This is the same scene in the play :", "Tell Lady Susan I wish to see her at once ."]}, "act_index": 6, "play_index": 6}, {"data": {"443": ["And will you say that I am here too ?", "Oh , certainly .

I recognize him there !People who think ramblingly and not clearly must undoubtedly on the stage speak in similar fashion , but it is wise when possible to avoid stating two or three ideas in the same sentence , or developing two or three ideas in one long speech . An idea to a sentence , with the development of one thought in a speech , is a fairly safe principle , though not unalterable . For instance , the daughter of a widowed mother is facing the fact that if they are to stay in their meagre quarters she may have to ask this as a favor from her employer , Mr. Hollings . The mother , not knowing that he has pressed his attentions objectionably , does not understand the unwillingness of the girl to ask his help . In answer to her pleadings the girl cries , \u201c Oh , I would do anything for you ! Poor dear father ! Mother , go to Mr. Hollings . \u201d Here are three different trains of thought in one speech . The first exclamation is a direct answer to the mother 's preceding speech . For the audience there is no clearness of transition to the second exclamation , nor from it to the third . Cut the girl 's answer to the first sentence . Then the mother , seizing on the idea that her daughter is willing to do anything , urges her for this and that reason to see her employer , emphasizing the idea that , had the father lived , all their present sorrow would not exist . In this case the second exclamation falls into its proper place , as a natural reply of the girl to her mother . If , too , as the mother urges reason after reason for going to the employer for aid , the girl at last pleads , \u201c Mother , you go to Mr. Hollings , \u201d this sentence also falls into its proper place . It becomes the first sign of her yielding , for she is at last willing that some one should intercede with the man . When a writer finds himself skipping from idea to idea within a speech or a sentence , with transitions likely to be unclear for the audience , he should break what he has written into its component parts and let the other people on the stage , by their interruptions , queries , and comments , provide the connectives of speech and thought which will bind these ideas together properly . The following rearrangement by Miss Anglin of the original text of Lady Windermere 's Fan shows her correct feeling that ideas originally treated together should be separated . Lord Windermere 's reply is to the first sentence of Mrs. Erlynne 's speech . It is therefore much clearer to shift her two succeeding exclamations to her next speech .

I suppose you know how to christen all right ?I mean , of course , you are continually christening , are n't you ?It is true that the last part of Chasuble 's speech illustrates his volubility , and that the way in which Jack picks up the idea , \u201c christening , \u201d shows that he is so absorbed in his purpose as to pay no attention to anything Chasuble says after \u201c christenings . \u201d Here , therefore , the method is probably justified , but ordinarily the end of one speech leads into the next , and when something which breaks the sequence stands between , it must prove its right to be there , or be postponed for later treatment , or be cut out altogether .

The first revision certainly gives lines easier to speak . The writer of the second revision hears it and knows the gesture , facial expression , and intonation which must go with \u201c This ! \u201d Dialogue which is perfectly clear and characterizing should not be allowed to pass in the final revision if at any point it is unnecessarily difficult to deliver . From the preceding discussion it must be clear that the three essentials of dialogue are clearness , helping the onward movement of the story , and doing all this in character . Dialogue is , naturally , still better if it possesses charm , grace , wit , irony , or beauty of its own . Dialogue which merely states the facts is , as we have seen , likely to be dull or commonplace . Well characterized dialogue still falls short of all dialogue may be if it has none of the attributes just mentioned . Feeling this strongly , the dramatists throughout the ages have striven to give their dialogue attractiveness because of its style , forgetting that above all for the dramatist it is true that \u201c style is the man , \u201d and that \u201c style is a thinking out into language . \u201d Lyly , Shakespeare , in some of the scenes of his early plays , Kyd in The Spanish Tragedy , John Dryden in his Heroic Drama , Cibber and Lillo in their rhythmic prose which often might be perfectly well printed as blank verse , strove to decorate their dialogue from without \u2014 something sure to fail , either with the immediate audience or with posterity . If the charm , the grace , the wit , the irony of the dialogue does not come from the characters speaking , that dialogue fails in what has been shown to be one of its chief essentials , right characterization . Congreve emphasized this in that classic of dramatic criticism , his letter Concerning Humour in Comedy .\u201c A character of a splenetic and peevish humour should have a satirical wit . A jolly and sanguine humour should have a facetious wit . The former should speak positively ; the latter , carelessly : for the former observes and shows things as they are ; the latter rather overlooks nature , and speaks things as he would have them ; and his wit and humour have both of them a less alloy of judgment than the others . \u201d Undoubtedly , however , the dramatist may do much in helping a character to reveal these qualities , particularly beauty of thought or phrasing .

Time about 11 at night", "Lucius O'Grady . Constable Moriarity , R. I. C . Timothy Doyle . Tom Kerrigan , bandmaster . Major Ken . Rev . Father McCormack . Thaddeus Golligher . Lord Alfred Blakeney . Horace P. Billing . Mrs. de Courvy . C. Gregg , district inspector . Mrs. Gregg . Sergeant Colgan , R. I. C . Mary Ellen . Into Ballymoy , a sleepy little town in the west of Ireland , comes Horace P. Billing , one gentle summer day , and spins in the market place a tale of a certain General John Regan , who , he said , these many years agone had been born and had sailed from Ballymoy to free the oppressed people of Bolivia , and who was the great national hero of that Republic from that time to the present day . Comes there to listen to his tale one Doctor Lucius O'Grady , whose nose can no more keep out of other people 's business than can his busy brain refrain from all manner of schemings or his tongue from uttering the grandest , gloriousest , whooping lies that the mouth of man e'er uttered . To the American tourist he unreels anecdote and episode dealing with the romantic life of the great General while he had been yet a boy in Ballymoy . He sends Golligher , the editor of the Connaught Eagle , to show the American gentleman the birthplace of the General , a broken down cow-shed , in a nearby field . The American leaves Ballymoy wildly excited and fermenting under the constant nagging of the doctor 's busy self and never resting tongue , and promises that he will be back in a few days , and that in the meantime , should the citizens of Ballymoy have enough patriotism in them to erect a statue of their great townie in the market place , he would contribute a hundred pounds towards it . This sets the Doctor at work with even morevim . He gets Doyle to promise to contribute ten pounds , the parish priestten also , Major Kent , the local landlord , another ten , and keeps the list himself \u2014 explaining that it is not necessary for him to put himself down for anything for that reason . It develops that Doyle has a nephew in Dublin who is a mortuary sculptor , and has a statue of some deceased citizen on hand which was never paid for . This statue Doyle 's nephew agrees to sell to Ballymoy for some eighty-odd pounds . The Doctor arranges to buy it , thus figuring that there will be a balance of twenty pounds out of the American 's contribution to divide among themselves . This pleases Doyle , Father McCormack , and Gollighervery much ; but unfortunately , it develops also that Doyle has neglected to get the money from the American for the statue before he left . This does not stump the Doctor in the least , however . Among his plans for the unveiling of the statue is the appearance of Mary Ellen , the servant in Doyle 's hotel , as a green fairy , and the appearance of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland to make a speech . He suggests that when the Lord Lieutenant appears , they ask him for five hundred pounds for a pier \u2014 as the town already has but five or six piers \u2014 and that the money for the statue be taken out of that . The Major objects to this , but the Doctor 's ability to explain does not desert him , and the Major is satisfied . The great day of the unveiling finally arrives . The statue from the mortuary sculptor in Dublin is standing in the market place , with a veil over it . A letter comes from the Lord Lieutenant to the effect that he has never heard of General John Regan , can find no record of him in any history of any country on the globe , and , in the person of his aide de camp , Lord Al Blakeney , protests and accuses Ballymoy of having put a hoax over on him and all that sort of bally rot , by Jove . The Doctor rises to the occasion beautifully . The aide de camp is made to make a speech as a representative of the Lord Lieutenant , and Mary Ellen unveils the statue , disclosing a hideous caricature of a grinning dead man in an ill-fitting business suit . At that moment the American appears , explains grandly that there is no such man as General John Regan , and says that if the Doctor can prove to him that the General is not a fiction he himself will give the five hundred pounds for the pier \u2014 as , he says , \u201c the show is worth it ! \u201d The Doctor merely asks the American to prove to the satisfaction of the assembled townsfolk that the General does not exist . Billing gives it up and writes out a check to the Doctor 's order for five hundred pounds , while the Doctor poses grandly before the cheers of the assembled and admiring populace of Ballymoy .Here , too , is an outline which led to a very dramatic sermon . Obviously it is a satisfactory summary of the story underlying the sermon , but just what it would give a reader , if it were a perfect scenario , is lacking \u2014 namely , suggestion of the emotional treatment of the scenes which is to make them worth the manager 's or actor 's producing : AT THE TOP OF THE TENEMENT The arrangement of the platform will suggest the bare condition of the home in the first part of the sermon , and in the second part will show the improved condition a year later . PART I Dan Howard comes home discouraged . He cannot get work . Christmas is approaching . His wife keeps his courage up and that of the family . The Minister calls and is not received kindly by Dan Howard , who does not believe in the church . He promises to get Dan work and thus proves himself a true friend in need . Misfortune has come to the home . The oldest boy is drinking and the next son has been arrested for theft . Things looks very black . It is Christmas eve and the father compels the children to go to bed . He tells them Santa Claus will not come to-night . But they hang up their stockings by the fireplace . PART II A year later . Things have changed . The home is better . All are happy tonight . The father has had steady work and so they are to have a good Christmas this year . The boys are doing well . The family all go to church now and it has made a difference in them all . The children have gone to bed with joy tonight . Dan Howard tells his wife what a help she has been to him through thick and thin . While they stand talking they hear the carol singers from the church , singing outside their home . The Minister comes in and is made very welcome . While they exchange greetings the Christmas Carol is sung and the beautiful illuminated star shines out in the night . The following may be full of dramatic suggestion for its writer , but if we mean by scenario a document which , when handed to a manager or actor , is to arouse his enthusiasm because it tells him interestingly just what a proposed play will do , this is not a scenario at all .

NOTES FOR THE MODERN TRAGEDY Rome , 19 . 10 , 78 . There are two kinds of spiritual law , two kinds of conscience , one in man and another , altogether different , in woman . They do not understand each other ; but in practical life the woman is judged by man 's law , as though she were not a woman but a man . The wife in the play ends by having no idea of what is right or wrong ; natural feeling on the one hand and belief in authority on the other have altogether bewildered her . A woman cannot be herself in the society of the present day , which is an exclusively masculine society , with laws framed by men and with a judicial system that judges feminine conduct from a masculine point of view . She has committed forgery , and she is proud of it ; for she did it out of love for her husband , to save his life . But this husband , with his commonplace principles of honour is on the side of the law and regards the question with masculine eyes .", "Gracious !

Then , with the scenario kept flexible and subject to change till the last possible moment , come many changes big and little , for better characterization and more atmosphere \u2014 see pp . 461-463 . Finally , more than anything else , as the author puts last touches to his scenario , or revises the play he has written from it , he scans its details in relation to the probable attitude toward them of his public . In the relation of that public to his subject and his treatment of it lie the most difficult problems of the dramatist . Solving them means the difference between the will to conquer and victory .

CHAPTER X THE DRAMATIST AND HIS PUBLIC Probably most dramatists have found that any play , either as a scenario or a completed manuscript , is not a matter of writing but of frequent re-writing . Study From Ibsen 's Workshop or most of the cases cited by Binet and Passy ,and it becomes evident that the first draft of a scenario or play is usually made mainly for clearness . That will be gained by good construction and correct emphasis . There follows a re-writing in which characterization improves greatly and dialogue becomes characterizing and attractive in itself . Either in this or possible later re-writings , the dramatist shapes his material more and more in relation to the public he wishes to address , for a dramatist is , after all , a sort of public speaker . Unlike the platform orator , however , he speaks indirectly to his audience \u2014 through people and under conditions he cannot wholly control . None the less , much if not all that concerns the persuasion of public argumentation concerns the dramatist . This does not in any sense mean that an author must truckle to his audience . Far from it . Yet no dramatist can work care free in regard to his audience . He must consider their natural likes and dislikes , interests and indifferences , their probable knowledge of his subject as well as their probable approach to it . As Mr. Archer has pointed out : \u201c The moment a playwright confines his work within the two or three hours \u2019 limit prescribed by Western custom for a theatrical performance , he is currying favour with an audience . That limit is imposed simply by the physical endurance and power of sustained attention that can be demanded of Western human beings assembled in a theatre . Doubtless an author could express himself more fully and more subtly if he ignored these limitations ; the moment he submits to them , he renounces the pretence that mere self-expression is his aim . \u201dOnce for all , what is \u201c truckling to an audience \u201d ? When an author , believing that the end of his play should be tragic , so plans his work that until the last act or even the middle of that act , a tragic ending is the logical conclusion , and then because he is told or believes that an audience will quit the theatre much more contented if the ending be happy , he forces a pleasant ending on his play , he is untrue to himself , dishonest with his art , and truckles to his public . A very large part of American audiences and many producers believe that any play is only mere entertainment and consequently may and should be so manipulated as to please the public even in its most unthinking mood . No man who does that is a dramatist . He is merely a hack playwright , bribed by the hope of immediate gain into slavish obedience to the most unthinking part of the public . On the other hand , an author is very foolish if he does not remember certain fundamental principles about audiences in a theatre . First , no matter what in his material attracts him , people rather than ideas arouse the interest of the general public . Secondly , even yet action far more than characterization wins and holds the attention of the great majority . These facts do not mean , however , that a dramatist must busy himself only with plays of action or characterization , foregoing all problems or thesis material . They do mean that if he is to write a play of ideas he must recognize that his task is the more difficult because of his public and that he must so handle it through the characterization and the action as to make his ideas widely interesting . In brief , insisting on saying what he wishes to say , he must learn to speak in terms his audience will readily understand . More than once a play good in itself has gone astray because written too much unto the author 's self , in the sense that certain figures have interested him more than others and he has forgotten that they are not likely to be interesting to the public at large and must be made so . For instance , a would-be adapter believed that the hero of the tale he was dramatizing would remain on the stage the hero still , but in action another character , with his songs and rough humor , and his constant action , in sharp contrast with the quiet speech and restrained movement of the central figure of the story , ran off with the interest . Consequently this adaptation , though unusually well done in all other respects , went awry . Another aspect of the same difficulty is that an author forgets to consider carefully whether something he finds comic or tragic will naturally be the same for his audiences . In a prize play produced some years ago in Germany , Belinda , the author found much comedy in the following situation . A rather addle-pated man has for some years been paying large sums to a correspondent , a woman as he believes , who has been painting his portrait again and again from photographs he has sent her . Little by little he has fallen in love with this correspondent . The day comes when he is awaiting a visit from her with the utmost delight . A servant , who knows that the woman is expected , enters looking utterly bewildered , and announces her arrival . There walks into the room a wizened Jewish picture dealer , who has all these years been playing on the vanity of the younger man for his own gain . Unfortunately the author forgot that an off-stage figure must be made very attractive if sympathy is to go with it rather than with a figure seen and known , or that the on-stage figure must be very unattractive if sympathy is not to go with it in contrast to a figure unseen . Consequently , when the Jew walked on he was greeted , not as the author expected with shouts of laughter , but with an aghast silence and obvious sympathy for the deceived man . Just at that point the play began to go to pieces because the author had misjudged , or not at all considered , the relation of the public to his material . Where , perhaps , authors fail with their public more than anywhere else is in motivation of the conduct of their characters .Too frequently a play slips because conduct as explained in it , though wholly convincing to the dramatist , does not similarly affect his public . It is useless for him to say stoutly that he knows the incident happened just in this way , or that the audience ought to know better than to think it could happen differently . As it is hopeless in life merely to protest that you are telling the truth when everybody is convinced that you are lying , it is wasted time for a dramatist to stand his ground in a matter of motivation if he has not succeeded in making that motivation convincing . For instance , there suddenly appears in the office of the hero of a play a former acquaintance of his , an actress . She has come to see him , if you please , even as her act in the theatre is playing . That is , simply because she so wished she has left the theatre during the performance . Now the dramatist may have known of such a case and people unacquainted with life behind the curtain may accept the situation , but people of the slightest experience in the theatre will know that no actor or actress playing an important role is allowed to leave during the performance . Instantly the scene becomes improbable for those people \u2014 and they are many . It must be so motivated as to be a probable exception in conduct , or the whole situation must be changed . If it be clear that , though a dramatist should never truckle to his audience , he cannot hope to write successfully unless at some time in his composition he revises his material with a view to the general intelligence , natural interests , and prejudices of his audience so far as his special subject is concerned , it is equally true that publics change greatly in their tastes . A young dramatist may learn much as to such shiftings in public taste by watching the revivals of plays once very successful . In Shakespeare 's day , for instance , the public would accept a mingling of the real and unreal with equanimity . Today it takes all the genius of Shakespeare to make the scenes of the ghost of Hamlet 's father convincing . In reading Chapman 's Bussy d'Ambois , with its strange commingling of real figures and ghosts , we today draw back disappointed because we feel that what has seemed real becomes with the entrance of the ghost only melodrama sublimated by some excellent characterization and fine poetry . As has already been pointed out , in Elizabethan days the public found cause for mirth in much which today is painful . Watch in performance the scene of Twelfth Night in which Toby , the Fool , and Maria deride Malvolio until they almost make him believe himself mad , and you have an admirable instance of changed taste . When first produced , it probably went with shouts of laughter . Because of sympathy for Malvolio it never goes well today . The public no longer finds madness unquestionably comic ; it has its hesitations on practical jokes ; it has lost a very little its sure enjoyment of drunkenness , especially in women . The day may conceivably come of which no one could say , as of the stage of our time : \u201c The single expletive \u2018 Damn \u2019 has saved many a would-be comic situation . \u201d The attitude of a playwright should not be , \u201c If my public ordinarily does not feel about this as I do , I will cut it out or make it conform to their usual tastes , \u201d but \u201c Knowing perfectly what the attitude of the public is toward my material , I will not cut it out until I have proved that it is not in my power to make the audience feel it as I do . \u201d Just here lies the worst temptation of the playwright . He who keeps his eye more on the money box than artistic self-respect will little by little limit his choice of subjects and conventionalize his treatment of them because he is told or believes that the public will not stand for this or that . Is it not , however , a little strange that almost everything which leading play-placers , managers , and actors have in the past twenty-five years declared the public would unwillingly accept or would not accept at all has since become not only acceptable but often popular . Some years ago it was a truism among readers of manuscript plays that college life was too limited in interest to appeal to the general theatre public . Then Mr. Ade 's The College Widow proved these prophets wrong . After this play trailed Brown of Harvard and a half-dozen other college plays which , whether good , bad , or indifferent artistically , were all warmly received by the public . Another statement once accepted in the theatrical world of New York was that American audiences no longer cared for farce , but Seven Days , followed by a crowding group of successes , changed all that . All this was not the result of any sudden revulsion on the part of the public , but came because some intelligent and clever workman , determining to make his interests and his sense of values the public 's , labored until he accomplished the task . Forthwith a delighted public begged for more and what was declared impossible became the vogue . Just at present there is a troublesome convention that the American public will not accept anything but farce or comedy . This means only that at the moment our writers of serious plays are not adept enough to win away large audiences from farce and comedy or to build up special audiences for their plays . Nevertheless , sooner or later , they or their successors will conquer such a public . In curious contradiction to the existing attitude that audiences will like only what they at present like , much advice is given as to novelty . \u201c Find something new in substance or form and your fortune is made \u201d is the implication . Wherein lies novelty of plot has already been explained .Certainly the large amount of experimentation which has been going on in recent years in one-act plays , two-act plays , or groups of one-act pieces bound together by a prologue and an epilogue , has all been well worth while , making as it does for greater flexibility of dramatic form . Yet it is unfortunately true at the present moment that most audiences prefer a three-or four-act play to something in two acts because the uninterrupted attention demanded by the last form asks too much from them . They prefer the three-act or four-act division to a group of one-act plays tied together by a prologue and an epilogue , because mere difference of form has no particular attraction for them and they do not willingly shift their interest as frequently as a group of one-act plays requires . Nevertheless there is nothing completely deterrent for a dramatist in any of these circumstances ; merely cause why , in every case , after thinking of the subject in relation to himself , he should ultimately consider it with equal care in relation to the audience for which he intends it . When , too , he is selecting his form he should observe whether though attractive to him , it may not be so difficult or repellent for the general public that another more conventional form is desirable . If he becomes sure that he cannot get his desired effects except in the form first chosen he must work until he makes it acceptable to the public or put aside his subject . The final test is not : \u201c What ordinarily do the public like in a subject like mine and in what form are they accustomed to see my subject treated , \u201d but : \u201c Can I so present the form I prefer as to make the public like equally with me what I find interesting in my subject ? \u201d That is , though presentation of a chosen subject should be flexible , the central purposes , human and artistic , of the play , should be maintained inflexibly . Bearing the audience in mind as one writes may affect the whole play , but more often it affects details \u2014 particularly order . The scenario of Kismethas been printed in full chiefly that the many changes it underwent in shaping it for final presentation might be clear . Among the many instances note , in Act II , that in the original form the love passage of Hajji followed plotting for the murder . When the play was in rehearsal , both actor and author felt at once that the sympathy it was necessary to maintain in the audience for Hajji would be lost if he turned immediately from such bloody plotting to the love scene . For this reason the order was changed . Surely there is no harm in such a shifting , for the story develops just as well and the characterization is as humanly true . This is a perfect illustration of persuasive arrangement . Take now the case of the torturing of Hajji , of which much was made in the original scenario . It is changed to the blow with the key because the horror of the scene when acted was too great and everything necessary is accomplished with the key . Here is a change made not to please the author but to make the material as treated produce in the audience the desired results , yet the change in no way interferes with any of the purposes of the dramatist . An illustration of the way in which a dramatist standing his ground because he is sure of the rightness of his psychology may win over his public is found in La Princesse Georges of Dumas fils . So great was the sympathy of the audience with Severine in her mortified wifehood that at the original performance , when she forgave her husband at the end , there were many dissenting cries . Dumas fils had foreseen this , but believing the ending truer to life than any other could be , he insisted on it . Ultimately the ending was accepted by the public as made necessary by the rest of the play . In all this discussion of the difference between truckling to an audience and necessary regard for its interests and prejudices , of changing public taste , the important point is that until a dramatist has considered his material in relation to the public , his play is by no means ready for production . Just because the persuasive side of dramatic art is so often neglected , play after play goes on the boards in such condition that it must be greatly changed before it can succeed . Often before these ample changes can be made , the public has lost interest in the piece . If a general principle might be laid down here it would be something like this . \u201c If you wish , first write your play so that to you it is something clear and convincing as well as something that moves to laughter or to tears . Before , however , it is tried on the stage , make sure that you have considered it in all details in so detached a way that you have a right to believe that , as a result of your careful revising , it will produce with the public the same interest , and the same emotions to the same degree as the original version did with you . \u201d Just here arises the ever present query , \u201c Why struggle to write what the public does not readily and quickly accept ? Why not study their unthinking likes and dislikes and give them what they want ? \u201d Certainly write in that way if it brings contentment , as it surely will bring monetary success if the play thus written really hits popular approval . However , aiming to hit popular taste is like shooting at a shifting target and a play so made may be staged just as the public makes one of its swift changes in theatrical mood . Of course , too , he who writes in this way is in no sense a leader but merely the slave of his public . In any case , his play is but an imitation , not an expression of the author 's individuality . Even would-be dramatists who do not hold the opportunist ideas just considered may draw back after reading what has been stated in this book , saying : \u201c How difficult and painstaking is this art of the drama which I have thought so fascinating and spontaneous . \u201d Of course , it is a difficult art . A good many years ago Sir Arthur Pinero said of it : \u201c When you sit in your stall at the theatre and see a play moving across the stage , it all seems so easy and so natural , you feel as though the author had improvised it . The characters , being , let us hope , ordinary human beings , say nothing very remarkable , nothing , you thinkthat might not quite well have occurred to you . When you take up a play-bookit strikes you as being a very trifling thing \u2014 a mere insubstantial pamphlet beside the imposing bulk of the latest six-shilling novel . Little do you guess that every page of the play has cost more care , severer mental tension , if not more actual manual labor , than any chapter of a novel , though it be fifty pages long . It is the height of the author 's art , according to the old maxim , that the ordinary spectator should never be clearly conscious of the skill and travail that have gone to the making of the finished product . But the artist who would achieve a like feat must realize that no ingots are to be got out of this mine , save after sleepless nights , days of gloom and discouragement , and other days , again , of feverish toil the result of which proves in the end to be misapplied and has to be thrown to the winds . \u201d Nevertheless , this difficult art remains fascinating ; and in practice , if rightly understood , it rapidly grows easier . In the understanding of any art there must be two stages . First comes the spontaneous doing of work very encouraging to the author and sufficiently good to warrant a person more experienced in encouraging him to proceed . Then begins the second stage , when he learns what can be taught him of technique in his chosen field . It is bound to be a time when consciousness of rules first learned and limitations first perceived make writing far less attractive and often so irksome that the worker is tempted to throw his task aside for good . He who does not really love his art will cast away his work . He who really cares cannot do this . He may from the hampering of these newly recognized rules become irritable , have his moments of self-doubt and despair , but he cannot stop practicing his art . With each new effort , the rules which have been so troublesome will become more and more a matter of habit . Little by little the writer will gain a curious subconscious power of using almost unthinkingly the principles he needs , giving no thought to those not needed . Then , and then only , will he write with the art that conceals art ; and it is only when he has attained to delight in the difficulties of the art he practices that he is in any true sense an artist . What ultimately happens is probably this . The critical attitude is strong in the scenario period , perhaps predominant as the dramatist works out construction , emphasis , proportion , etc ., but when , with the scenario before him , he takes his pen in hand , he lets the creative impulse swamp completely the critical sense and loses himself in his task . Or he reverses the process . He writes in pure creative abandon , until at least an act of a play lies completed before him . Then , with his critical training brought to the front , he goes over and over the manuscript until what was a pure creative effort has been chastened and sublimated by his trained critical sense . The main point is : Do n't stultify your creative instincts by trying to use critical training at the same time . As far as possible , let one precede the other . Write creatively . Then correct . Or write with the critical instinct strongly to the front until all plans are made . Then forget everything except the spirit of creation . Where dramatists in training waste their nervous energy and often stultify their best desires is in keeping critical tab upon themselves as they create . Writing something with pure delight , they are suddenly blocked by the critical spirit saying : \u201c This or that is bad . You cannot keep this or that as you have written it , \u201d and presto ! no more creative work that day . Unless the critical and creative faculties interwork sympathetically and cooperatively , keep them separate . Whoever aims to write plays chiefly or wholly because he would like fame or money or because he wishes to show that he is as strong in one fictional art as another ,\u2014 the story , the essay , the poem , whatever it may be ,\u2014 in fact he who writes plays for any other reason than that he cannot be happy except in writing plays , better give over such writing . Play-making is an exceedingly difficult art , and in so far as it is in any sense a transcript from life or a beautified presentation of life past , present , or imagined , it grows more difficult as the years pass because of the accumulating mass of dramatic masterpieces . Yet for him who cares for dramatic writing more than any form of self-expression , no time has been more promising than the present . There has been more good drama in the past twenty-five years the world over than at any time in the history of the stage . It has been more varied in subject and form , more individual in treatment . The drama is today more flexible , more daring and experimental , than ever before . It is in closer relation to all the subtlest and most advanced of man 's thinking . It has been breaking new ways for itself , and it has new ways yet to break . All that has been said in this book concerns merely the historic foundations of this very great art . Accept these principles as stated or quarrel with most of them ; but realize that any principles , whether accepted from others or self-taught , should be but the beginning of a life-long training by which the individual will pass from what he shares of general dramatic experience to what is peculiarly his own expression .

You will reorganize the scheme efficiently ; you will liquidate its second bankruptcy efficiently; you will get rid of its original shareholders efficiently after efficiently ruining them ; and you will finally profit very efficiently by getting that hotel for a few shillings in the pound .Besides those efficient operations , you will foreclose your mortgages most efficiently; you will drive Haffigan to America very efficiently ; you will find a use for Barney Doran 's foul mouth and bullying temper by employing him to slave-drive your laborers very efficiently ; andwhen at last this poor desolate countryside becomes a busy mint in which we shall all slave to make money for you , with our Polytechnic to teach us how to do it efficiently , and our library to fuddle the few imaginations your distilleries will spare , and our repaired Round Tower with admission sixpence , and refreshments and penny-in-the-slot mutoscopes to make it interesting , then no doubt your English and American shareholders will spend all the money we make for them very efficiently in shooting and hunting , in operations for cancer and appendicitis , in gluttony and gambling ; and you will devote what they save to fresh land development schemes .

But the end will come .", "And we have none : only empty enthusiasms and patriotisms , and emptier memories and regrets .

It is a place where the hardest toil is a welcome refuge from the horror and tedium of pleasure , and where charity and good works are done only for hire to ransom the souls of the spoiler and the sybarite . Now , sir , there is only one place of horror and torment known to my religion ; and that place is hell . Therefore it is plain to me that this earth of ours must be hell , and that we are all here , as the Indian revealed to me \u2014 perhaps he was sent to reveal it to me to expiate crimes committed by us in a former existence ."]}, "act_index": 12, "play_index": 12}, {"data": {"627": ["Why should he come ?

He makes no fuss ; manages to get a private interview with the person who is passing as himself ; when , of course , he soon discovers that poor Mr. Spurrell is as much deceived as anybody else . What is he to do ? Humiliate the unfortunate man by letting him know the truth ? Mortify my uncle and aunt by a public explanation before a whole dinner-party ? That is what a stupid or a selfish man might have done , almost without thinking . But not Mr. Blair . He has too much tact , too much imagination , too much chivalry for that . He saw at once that his only course was to spare his host and hostess , and \u2014 and all of us a scene , by slipping away quietly and unostentatiously , as he had come . Lady RhodaIf he saw all that , why did n't he do it ? Lady MaisieWhy ? How provoking you can be , Rhoda ! Why ? Because that stupid Tredwell would n't let him ! Because Archie delayed him by some idiotic practical joke ! Because Mr. Spurrell went and blurted it all out !... Oh , do n't try to run down a really fine act like that ; because you can n't \u2014 you simply can n't ! Lady RhodaNo idea it had gone so far as that \u2014 already !

Lady MaisieNow , Rhoda , I wo n't have you talking as if \u2014 as if \u2014\u2014 You ought to know , if Gerald Thicknesse does n't , that it 's nothing at all of that sort ! It 's just \u2014\u2014 Oh , I can n't tell you how some of his poems moved me , what new ideas , wider views they seemed to teach ; and then how dreadfully it hurt to think it was only Mr. Spurrell after all !... But now \u2014 oh , the relief of finding they 're not spoilt ; that I can still admire , still look up to the man who wrote them ! Not to have to feel that he is quite commonplace \u2014 not even a gentleman \u2014 in the ordinary sense ! Lady RhodaAh well , I prefer a hero who looks as if he had his hair cut , occasionally \u2014 but then , I 'm not romantic . He may be the paragon you say ; but if I was you , my dear , I would n't expect too much of that young man \u2014 allow a margin for shrinkage , do n't you know . And now I think I 'll turn into my little crib , for I 'm dead tired . Good night ; do n't sit up late readin \u2019 poetry ; it 's my opinion you 've read quite enough as it is !Lady MaisieShe does n't in the least understand ! She actually suspects me of \u2014\u2014 As if I could possibly \u2014 or as if mamma would ever \u2014 even if he \u2014\u2014 Oh , how silly I am !... I do n't care ! I am glad I have n't had to give up my ideal . I should like to know him better . What harm is there in that ? And if Gerald chooses to go to-morrow , he must \u2014 that 's all .

LYRICS JAEL Jehovah ! Jehovah ! art Thou not stronger than gods of the heathen ? I slew him , that Sisera , prince of the host Thou dost hate . But fear of his blood is upon me , about me is breathen His spirit \u2014 by night and by day come voices that wait . Athirst and affrightened he fled from the star-wrought waters of Kishon . His face was as wool when he swooned at the door of my tent . The Lord hath given him into the hand of perdition , I smiled \u2014 but he saw not the face of my cunning intent . He thirsted for water : I fed him the curdless milk of the cattle . He lay in the tent under purple and crimson of Tyre . He slept and he dreamt of the surge and storming of battle . Ah ha ! but he woke not to waken Jehovah 's ire . He slept as he were a chosen of Israel 's God Almighty . A dog out of Canaan !\u2014 thought he I was woman alone ? I slipt like an asp to his ear and laughed for the sight he Would give when the carrion kites should tear to his bone . I smote thro \u2019 his temple the nail , to the dust a worm did I bind him . My heart was a-leap with rage and a-quiver with scorn . And I danced with a holy delight before and behind him \u2014 I that am called blessed o'er all who 're of Judah born . \u201c Aye , come , I will show thee , O Barak , a woman is more than a warrior , \u201d I cried as I lifted the door wherein Sisera lay . \u201c To me did he fly and I shall be called his destroyer \u2014 I , Jael , who am subtle to find for the Lord a way ! \u201d \u201c Above all the daughters of men be blest \u2014 of Gilead or Asshur , \u201d Sang Deborah , prophetess , under her waving palm . \u201c Behold her , ye people , behold her the heathen 's abasher ; Behold her the Lord hath uplifted \u2014 behold and be calm . \u201c The mother of him at the window looks out thro \u2019 the lattice to listen \u2014 Why roll not the wheels of his chariot ? why does he stay ? Shall he not return with the booty of battle , and glisten In songs of his triumph \u2014 ye women , why do ye not say ? \u201d And I was as she who danced when the Seas were rendered asunder And stood , until Egypt pressed in to be drowned unto death . My breasts were as fire with the glory , the rocks that were under My feet grew quick with the gloating that beat in my breath . At night I stole out where they cast him , a sop to the jackal and raven . But his bones stood up in the moon and I shook with affright . The strength shrank out of my limbs and I fell a craven Before him \u2014 the nail in his temple gleamed bloodily bright . Jehovah ! Jehovah ! art Thou not stronger than gods of the heathen ? I slew him , that Sisera , prince of the host Thou dost hate . But fear of his blood is upon me , about me is breathen His spirit \u2014 by day and by night come voices that wait . I fly to the desert , I fly to the mountain \u2014 but they will not hide me . His gods haunt the winds and the caves with vengeance that cries For judgment upon me ; the stars in their courses deride me \u2014 The stars Thou hast hung with a breath in the wandering skies . Jehovah ! Jehovah ! I slew him the scourge and sting of Thy Nation . Take from me his spirit , take from me the voice of his blood . With madness I rave \u2014 by day and by night , defamation ! Jehovah , release me ! Jehovah ! if still Thou art God ! MARY AT NAZARETH I know , Lord , Thou hast sent Him \u2014 Thou art so good to me !\u2014 But Thou hast only lent Him , His heart 's for Thee ! I dared \u2014 Thy poor hand-maiden \u2014 Not ask a prophet-child : Only a boy-babe laden For earth \u2014 and mild . But this one Thou hast given Seems not for earth \u2014 or me ! His lips flame truth from heaven , And vanity Seem all my thoughts and prayers When He but speaks Thy Law ; Out of my heart the tares Are torn by awe ! I cannot look upon Him So strangely burn His eyes \u2014 Hath not some grieving drawn Him From Paradise ? For Thee , for Thee I 'd live , Lord ! Yet oft I almost fall Before Him \u2014 Oh , forgive , Lord , My sinful thrall ! But e'en when He was nursing , A baby at my breast , It seemed He was dispersing The world 's unrest . Thou bad'st me call Him \u201c Jesus \u201d And from our heavy sin I know He shall release us , From Sheol win . But , Lord , forgive ! the yearning That He may sometimes be Like other children , learning Beside my knee , Or playing , prattling , seeking For help ,\u2014 comes to my heart .... Ah sinful , Lord , I 'm speaking \u2014 How good Thou art ! OUTCAST I did not fear , But crept close up to Christ and said , \u201c Is He not here ? \u201d They drew me back \u2014 The seraphs who had never bled Of weary lack \u2014 But still I cried , With torn robe , clutching at His feet , \u201c Dear Christ ! He died So long ago ! Is He not here ? Three days , unfleet As mortal flow Of time I 've sought \u2014 Till Heaven 's amaranthine ways Seem as sere nought ! \u201d A grieving stole Up from His heart and waned the gaze Of His clear soul Into my eyes . \u201c He is not here , \u201d troubled He sighed . \u201c For none who dies Beliefless may Bend lips to this sin-healing Tide , And live alway . \u201d Then darkness rose Within me , and drear bitterness . Out of its throes I moaned , at last , \u201c Let me go hence ! Take off the dress , The charms Thou hast Around me strown ! Beliefless too am I without His love \u2014 and lone ! \u201d Unto the Gate They led me , tho \u2019 with pitying doubt . I did not wait But stepped across Its portal , turned not once to heed Or know my loss . Then my dream broke , And with it every loveless creed \u2014 Beneath love 's stroke . ADELIL Proud Adelil ! Proud Adelil ! Why does she lie so cold ?We sat at banquet , many maids , She like a Valkyr free .In emerald cups was poured the mead ; Icily blew the night .\u201c A goblet to my love ! \u201d she cried , \u201c Prince where the sea-winds fly ! \u201dShe lifted the cup and drank \u2014 she saw A heart within its lees .They looked upon her stricken still , And sudden they grew appalled .Palely she took it \u2014 did it give Ease there against her breast ?THE DYING POET Swing in thy splendour , O silent sun , Drawing my heart with thee over the west ! Done is its day as thy day is done , Fallen its quest ! Swoon into purple and rose \u2014 then sink , Tho \u2019 to arise again out of the dawn . Sink while I praise thee , ere thro \u2019 the dark link Of death I am drawn ! Sunk ? art thou sunken ? how great was life ! I like a child could cry for it again \u2014 Cry for its beauty , pang , fleeting and strife , Its women , its men ! For , how I drained it with love and delight ! Opened its heart with the magic of grief ! Reaped every season \u2014 its day and its night ! Loved every sheaf ! Aye , not a meadow my step has trod , Never a flower swung sweet to my face , Never a heart that was touched of God , But taught me its grace . Off , from my lids then a moment yet , Fingering Death , for again I must see Miraged by memory all that I met Under Time 's lee . There !... I 'm a child again \u2014 fair , so fair ! Under the eyes does a marvel not burn ? Speak they not vision , song , frenzy to dare , That still in me yearn ?... Youth ! my wild youth !\u2014 O , blood of my heart , Still you can answer with whirling the thought ! Still like the mountain-born rapid can dart , Joyous , distraught !... Love , and her face again ! there by the wood !\u2014 Come thou invisible Dark with thy mask ! Shall I not learn if she lives ? and could I more of thee ask ?... Turn me away from the ashen west , Where love 's sad planet unveils to the dusk . Something is stealing like light from my breast \u2014 Soul from its husk ... Soft !... Where the dead feel the buried dead , Where the high hermit-bell hourly tolls , Bury me , near to the haunting tread Of life that o'errolls . ON THE MOOR 1 I met a child upon the moor A-wading down the heather ; She put her hand into my own , We crossed the fields together . I led her to her father 's door \u2014 A cottage mid the clover . I left her \u2014 and the world grew poor To me , a childless rover . 2 I met a maid upon the moor , The morrow was her wedding . Love lit her eyes with lovelier hues Than the eve-star was shedding . She looked a sweet goodbye to me , And o'er the stile went singing . Down all the lonely night I heard But bridal bells a-ringing . 3 I met a mother on the moor , By a new grave a-praying . The happy swallows in the blue Upon the winds were playing . \u201c Would I were in his grave , \u201d I said , \u201c And he beside her standing ! \u201d There was no heart to break if death For me had made demanding . HUMAN LOVE We spoke of God and Fate , And of that Life \u2014 which some await \u2014 Beyond the grave . \u201c It will be fair , \u201d she said , \u201c But love is here ! I only crave thy breast Not God 's when I am dead . For He nor wants nor needs My little love . But it may be , if I love thee And those whose sorrow daily bleeds , He knows \u2014 and somehow heeds ! \u201d OH , GO NOT OUT Oh , go not out upon the storm , Go not , my sweet , to Swalchie pool ! A witch tho \u2019 she be dead may charm Thee and befool . A wild night \u2018 tis ! her lover 's moan , Down under ooze and salty weed , She 'll make thee hear \u2014 and then her own ! Till thou shall heed . And it will suck upon thy heart \u2014 The sorcery within her cry \u2014 Till madness out of thee upstart , And rage to die . For him she loved , she laughed to death ! And as afloat his chill hand lay , \u201c Ha , ha ! to hell I sent his wraith ! \u201d Did she not say ? And from his finger strive to draw The ring that bound him to her spell ?\u2014 But on her closed his hand \u2014 she saw ... Oh , who can tell ? For tho \u2019 she strove \u2014 tho \u2019 she did wail , The dead hand held her cold and fast : The tide crawled in o'er rock and swale , To her at last ! Down in the pool where she was swept He holds her \u2014 Oh , go not a-near ! For none has heard her cry but wept And died that year . CALL TO YOUR MATE , BOB-WHITE O call to your mate , bob-white , bob-white , And I will call to mine . Call to her by the meadow-gate , And I will call by the pine . Tell her the sun is hid , bob-white , The windy wheat sways west . Whistle again , call clear and run To lure her out of her nest . For when to the copse she comes , shy bird , With Mary down the lane I 'll walk , in the dusk of locust tops , And be her lover again . Ay , we will forget our hearts are old , And that our hair is gray . We 'll kiss as we kissed at pale sunset One summer 's halcyon day . That day , can it fade ?... ah , bob , bob-white , Still calling \u2014 calling still ? We 're coming \u2014 a-coming , bent and weighed , But glad with the old love 's thrill ! TRANSCENDED I who was learned in death 's lore Oft held her to my heart And spoke of days when we should love no more \u2014 In the long dust , apart . \u201c Immortal ? \u201d No \u2014 it could not be , Spirit with flesh must die .

For just now , when , full of alarm , I rushed into the house , expecting to find my wife afflicted with some other malady than what I have found it to be ;\u2014 ah me ! immediately the servant-maids beheld that I had arrived , they all at the same moment joyfully exclaimed , \u201c He is come ,\u201d from having so suddenly caught sight of me . But I soon perceived the countenances of all of them change ,because at so unseasonable a juncture chance had brought me there . One of them in the mean time hastily ran before me to give notice that I had come . Impatient to see my wife , I followed close . When I entered the room , that instant , to my sorrow , I found out her malady ; for neither did the time afford any interval to enable her to conceal it , nor could she complain in any other accents than { those which } the case itself prompted . When I perceived { this }: \u201c O disgraceful conduct !\u201d I exclaimed , and instantly hurried away from the spot in tears , overwhelmed by such an incredible and shocking circumstance . Her mother followed me ; just as I got to the threshold , she threw herself on her knees : I felt compassion for her . Assuredly it is the fact , in my opinion , just as matters befall us all , so are we elated or depressed . At once she began to address me in these words : \u201c O my { dear } Pamphilus , you see the reason why she left your house ; for violence was offered to her when formerly a maid , by some villain to us unknown . Now , she took refuge here then , that from you and others she might conceal her labor .\u201d But when I call to mind her entreaties , I can not , wretched as I am , refrain from tears . \u201c Whatever chance or fortune it is ,\u201d said she , \u201c which has brought you here to-day , by it we do both conjure you , if with equity and justice we may , that her misfortune may be concealed by you , and kept a secret from all . If ever you were sensible , my { dear } Pamphilus , that she was tenderly disposed toward you , she now asks you to grant her this favor in return , without making any difficulty of it . But as to taking her back , act quite according to your own convenience . You alone are aware of her lying-in , and that the child is none of yours . For it is said that it was two months after the marriage before she had commerce with you . And then , this is but the seventh month since she came to you .That you are sensible of this , the circumstances themselves prove . Now , if it is possible , Pamphilus , I especially wish , and will use my endeavors , that her labor may remain unknown to her father , and to all , in fact . But if that can not be managed , and they do find it out , I will say that she miscarried ; I am sure no one will suspect otherwise than , what is so likely , the child was by you . It shall be instantly exposed ; in that case there is no inconvenience whatever to yourself , and you will be concealing an outrage so undeservingly committed upon her ,poor thing !\u201d I promised { this }, and I am resolved to keep faith in what I said . But as to taking her back , really I do not think that would be at all creditable , nor will I do so , although love for her , and habit , have a strong influence upon me . I weep when it occurs to my mind , what must be her life , and { how great } her loneliness in future . O Fortune , thou hast never been found constant ! But by this time { my } former passion has taught me experience in the present case . The means by which I got rid of that , I must employ on the present occasion . Parmeno is coming with the servants ; it is far from convenient that he should be here under present circumstances , for he was the only person to whom I trusted the secret that I kept aloof from her when I first married her . I am afraid lest , if he should frequently hear her cries , he might find out that she is in labor . He must be dispatched by me somewhere till Philumena is delivered .", "Consider to what you are persuading me .", "Oho !", "Tell the truth .", "Once more , take care , will you , my { dear } Parmeno , that you have brought me a faithful and distinct account , so as not to allure me for a short time to indulge in these transient joys .", "Prick up your ears , Pamphilus .", "So they say .", "She is a little better .", "What { does } Chremes { do }? He who had declared that he would not intrust his daughter to me as a wife ; because he { himself } sees me unchanged he has changed .

That any man should be so unhappy in love , or { so } unfortunate as I am ! Oh , faith of Gods and men ! shall I by no device be able to escape { this } alliance with Chremes ?

FOOTNOTES\u2014 M. Juventius Thalna and Ti . Sempronius Gracchus were Consuls in the year from the Building of the City 589 , and B. C . 164 . ]\u2014 Ver . 1 . He refers to the fact that the Prologue was in general spoken by young men , whereas it is here spoken by L. Ambivius Turpio , the leader of the Company , a man stricken in years . The Prologue was generally not recited by a person who performed a character in the opening Scene . ]\u2014 Ver . 3 . His meaning seems to be , that he will first tell them the reason why he , who is to take a part in the opening Scene , speaks the Prologue , which is usually spoken by a young man who does not take part in that Scene ; and that he will then proceed to speak in character, as Chremes , in the first Scene . His reason for being chosen to speak the Prologue , is that he may be a pleaderfor the Poet , a task which would be likely to be better performed by him than by a younger man . ]\u2014 Ver . 4 . In contradistinction to such Plays as the Andria , as to which it was a subject of complaint that it had been formed out of a mixtureof the Andrian and Perinthian of Menander . ]\u2014 Ver . 6 . Vollbehr suggests that the meaning of this line is , that though it is but one Play , it has a two-fold plot \u2014 the intrigues of two young men with two mistresses , and the follies of two old men . As this Play is supposed to represent the events of two successive days , the night intervening , it has been suggested that the reading is \u201c duplex \u2014 ex argumento \u2014 simplici ;\u201d the Play is \u201c two-fold , with but one plot ,\u201d as extending to two successive days . The Play derives its name from the Greek words , \u1f11\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd , \u201c himself ,\u201d and \u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03c9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u1f78\u03c2 , \u201c tormenting .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 11 . He is to be the pleader and advocate of the Poet , to influence the Audience in his favor , and against his adversaries ; and not to explain the plot of the Play . Colman has the following observation : \u201c It is impossible not to regret that there are not above ten lines of the Self-Tormentor preserved among the Fragments of Menander . We are so deeply interested by what we see of that character in Terence , that one can not but be curious to inquire in what manner the Greek Poet sustained it through five Acts . The Roman author , though he has adopted the title of the Greek Play , has so altered the fable , that Menedemus is soon thrown into the background , and Chremes is brought forward as the principal object ; or , to vary the allusion a little , the Menedemus of Terence seems to be a drawing in miniature copied from a full length , as large as the life , by Menander .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 22 . He alludes to his old enemy , Luscus Lavinius , referred to in the preceding Prologue . ]\u2014 Ver . 24 . He alludes to a report which had been spread , that his friends L\u00e6lius and Scipio had published their own compositions under his name . Servilius is also mentioned by Eugraphius as another of his patrons respecting whom similar stories were circulated . ]\u2014 Ver . 31 . He probably does not intend to censure this practice entirely in Comedy , but to remind the Audience that in some recent Play of Luscus Lavinius this had been the sole stirring incident introduced . Plautus introduces Mercury running in the guise of Sosia , in the fourth Scene of the Amphitryon , l. 987 , and exclaiming , \u201c For surely , why , faith , should I , a God , be any less allowed to threaten the public , if it doesn \u2019 t get out of my way , than a slave in the Comedies ?\u201d This practice can not , however , be intended to be here censured by Plautus , as he is guilty of it in three other instances . In the Mercator , Acanthio runs to his master Charinus , to tell him that his mistress Pasicompsa has been seen in the ship by his father Demipho ; in the Stichus , Pinacium , a slave , runs to inform his mistress Philumena that her husband has arrived in port , on his return from Asia ; and in the Mostellaria , Tranio , in haste , brings information of the unexpected arrival of Theuropides . The \u201c currens servus \u201d is also mentioned in the Prologue to the Andria , l. 36 . See the soliloquy of Stasimus , in the Trinummus of Plautus , l . 1007 . ]\u2014 Ver . 36 . \u201c Statariam .\u201d See the spurious Prologue to the Bacchides of Plautus , l. 10 , and the Note to the passage in Bohn \u2019 s Translation . The Comedy of the Romans was either \u201c stataria \u201d, \u201c motoria \u201d, or \u201c mixta \u201d. \u201c Stataria \u201d was a Comedy which was calm and peaceable , such as the Cistellaria of Plautus ; \u201c motoria \u201d was one full of action and disturbance , like his Amphitryon ; while the \u201c Com\u0153dia mixta \u201d was a mixture of both , such as the Eunuchus of Terence . ]\u2014 Ver . 47 . \u201c In utramque partem ingenium quid possit meum .\u201d This line is entirely omitted in Vollbehr \u2019 s edition ; but it appears to be merely a typographical error . ]\u2014 Ver . 72 . Vollbehr thinks that his meaning is , that he is quite vexed to see so little progress made , in spite of his neighbor \u2019 s continual vexation and turmoil , and that , as he says in the next line , he is of opinion that if he were to cease working himself , and were to overlook his servants , he would get far more done . It is more generally thought to be an objection which Chremes suggests that Menedemus may possibly make . ]\u2014 Ver . 77 . \u201c Homo sum : humani nihil a me alienum puto .\u201d St. Augustine says , that at the delivery of this sentiment , the Theatre resounded with applause ; and deservedly , indeed , for it is replete with the very essence of benevolence and disregard of self . Cicero quotes the passage in his work De Officiis , B. i ., c. 9 . The remarks of Sir Richard Steele upon this passage , in the Spectator , No . 502 , are worthy to be transcribed at length . \u201c The Play was the Self-Tormentor . It is from the beginning to the end a perfect picture of human life , but I did not observe in the whole one passage that could raise a laugh . How well-disposed must that people be , who could be entertained with satisfaction by so sober and polite mirth ! In the first Scene of the Comedy , when one of the old men accuses the other of impertinence for interposing in his affairs , he answers , \u2018 I am a man , and can not help feeling any sorrow that can arrive at man .\u2019 It is said this sentence was received with an universal applause . There can not be a greater argument of the general good understanding of a people , than their sudden consent to give their approbation of a sentiment which has no emotion in it . If it were spoken with ever so great skill in the actor , the manner of uttering that sentence could have nothing in it which could strike any but people of the greatest humanity \u2014 nay , people elegant and skillful in observation upon it . It is possible that he may have laid his hand on his heart , and with a winning insinuation in his countenance , expressed to his neighbor that he was a man who made his case his own ; yet I will engage , a player in Covent Garden might hit such an attitude a thousand times before he would have been regarded .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 124 . As to the \u201c socci ,\u201d or low shoes of the ancients , see the Notes to the Trinummus of Plautus , l. 720 , in Bohn \u2019 s Translation . It was the especial duty of certain slaves to take off the shoes of their masters . ]\u2014 Ver . 125 . The \u201c lecti \u201d or \u201c couches \u201d upon which the ancients reclined at meals , have been enlarged upon in the Notes to Plautus , where full reference is also made to the \u201c coena \u201d or \u201c dinner ,\u201d and other meals of the Romans . ]\u2014 Ver . 130 . It was the custom for the mistress and female servants in each family to make the clothes of the master . Thus in the Fasti of Ovid , B . ii ., l. 746 , Lucretia is found amidst her female servants , making a cloak , or \u201c lacerna ,\u201d for her husband . Suetonius says that Augustus refused to wear any garments not woven by his female relations . Cooke seems to think that \u201c vestiant \u201d alludes to the very act of putting the clothes upon a person . He says , \u201c The better sort of people had eating-dresses , which are here alluded to . These dresses were light garments , to put on as soon as they had bathed . They commonly bathed before eating , and the chief meal was in the evening .\u201d This , however , does not seem to be the meaning of the passage , although Colman has adopted it . We may here remark that the censure here described is not unlike that mentioned in the Prologue to the Mercator of Plautus , as administered by Dem\u00e6netus to his son Charinus . ]\u2014 Ver . 141 . \u201c Vas \u201d is here used as a general name for articles of furniture . This line appears to be copied almost literally from one of Menander , which still exists . ]\u2014 Ver . 145 . On the mode of advertising houses to let or be sold among the Romans , see the Trinummus of Plautus , l. 168 , and the Note to the passage in Bohn \u2019 s Translation . ]\u2014 Ver . 151 . The plural \u201c liberos \u201d is here used to signify the one son which Menedemus has . So in the Hecyra , l. 217 , the same word is used to signify but one daughter . This was a common mode of expression in the times of the earlier Latin authors . ]\u2014 Ver . 162 . It is generally supposed that there were four Festivals called the Dionysia , during the year , at Athens . The first was the Rural , or Lesser Dionysia , \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4 \u1fbd \u1f00\u03b3\u03c1\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 , a vintage festival , which was celebrated in the \u201c Demi \u201d or boroughs of Attica , in honor of Bacchus , in the month Poseidon . This was the most ancient of the Festivals , and was held with the greatest merriment and freedom ; the slaves then enjoyed the same amount of liberty as they did at the Saturnalia at Rome . The second Festival , which was called the Lensea , from \u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u1f78\u03c2 , a wine-press , was celebrated in the month Gamelion , with Scenic contests in Tragedy and Comedy . The third Dionysian Festival was the Anthesteria , or \u201c Spring feast ,\u201d being celebrated during three days in the month Anthesterion . The first day was called \u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03bf\u1f77\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 , or \u201c the Opening of the casks ,\u201d as on that day the casks were opened to taste the wine of the preceding year . The second day was called \u03c7\u03bf\u03b5\u03c2 , from \u03c7\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 , \u201c a cup ,\u201d and was probably devoted to drinking . The third day was called \u03c7\u03c5\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u1f76 , from \u03c7\u03c5\u03c4\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 , \u201c a pot ,\u201d as on it persons offered pots with flower-seeds or cooked vegetables to Dionysus or Bacchus . The fourth Attic festival of Dionysius was celebrated in the month Elaphebolion , and was called the Dionysia \u1f10\u03bd \u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9 , \u0391\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f70 , or \u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u1f70 , the \u201c City \u201d or \u201c great \u201d festival . It was celebrated with great magnificence , processions and dramatic representations forming part of the ceremonial . From Greece , by way of Sicily , the Bacchanalia , or festivals of Bacchus , were introduced into Rome , where they became the scenes of and pretext for every kind of vice and debauchery , until at length they were put down in the year B. C . 187 , with a strong hand , by the Consuls Spurius Posthumius Albinus and Q. Marcius Philippus ; from which period the words \u201c bacchor \u201d and \u201c bacchator \u201d became synonymous with the practice of every kind of vice and turpitude that could outrage common decency . See a very full account of the Dionysia and the Bacchanalia in Dr. Smith \u2019 s Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities . ]\u2014 Ver . 199 . He means that it is to the advantage of Clitipho that Clinia should be seen to stand in awe of his father . ]\u2014 Ver . 205 . \u201c Homo ,\u201d \u201c a man ,\u201d is here put for men in general who are fathers . ]\u2014 Ver . 218 . There is a jingle intended here in the resemblance of the words \u201c cognoscendi ,\u201d \u201c knowing ,\u201d and \u201c ignoscendi ,\u201d \u201c pardoning .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 228 . \u201c Recte est .\u201d It is supposed that he pauses before uttering these words , which mean \u201c very well ,\u201d or \u201c very good ,\u201d implying the giving an assent without making a promise ; he tells the reason , in saying that he has scruples or prejudices against confessing that he has got nothing to give her . ]\u2014 Ver . 239 . That is , from the place where they are , in the country , to Athens . ]\u2014 Ver . 245 . The train and expenses of a courtesan of high station are admirably depicted in the speech of Lysiteles , in the Trinummus of Plautus , l . 252 . ]\u2014 Ver . 286 . Among the Greeks , in general , mourning for the dead seems to have lasted till the thirtieth day after the funeral , and during that period black dresses were worn . The Romans also wore mourning for the dead , which seems , in the time of the Republic , to have been black or dark blue for either sex . Under the Empire the men continued to wear black , but the women wore white . No jewels or ornaments were worn upon these occasions . ]\u2014 Ver . 289 . By \u201c null\u00e2 mal\u00e2 re muliebri \u201d he clearly means that they did not find her painted up with the cosmetics which some women were in the habit of using . Such preparations for the face as white-lead , wax , antimony , or vermilion , well deserve the name of \u201c mala res .\u201d A host of these cosmetics will be found described in Ovid \u2019 s Fragment \u201c On the Care of the Complexion ,\u201d and much information upon this subject is given in various passages in the Art of Love . In the Remedy of Love , l. 351 , Ovid speaks of these practices in the following terms : \u201c At the moment , too , when she shall be smearing her face with the cosmetics laid up on it , you may come into the presence of your mistress , and don \u2019 t let shame prevent you . You will find there boxes , and a thousand colors of objects ; and you will see \u2018 oesypum ,\u2019 the ointment of the fleece , trickling down and flowing upon her heated bosom . These drugs , Phineus , smell like thy tables ; not once alone has sickness been caused by this to my stomach .\u201d Lucretius also , in his Fourth Book , l. 1168 , speaks of a female who \u201c covers herself with noxious odors , and whom her female attendants fly from to a distance , and chuckle by stealth .\u201d See also the Mostellaria of Plautus , Act I ., Scene 3 , l. 135 , where Philematium is introduced making her toilet on the stage . ]\u2014 Ver . 291 . \u201c Pax ,\u201d literally \u201c peace !\u201d in the sense of \u201c Hush !\u201d \u201c Be quiet !\u201d See the Notes to the Trinummus of Plautus , ll . 889-891 , in Bohn \u2019 s Translation . ]\u2014 Ver . 293 .

See also the Epistle of Penelope to Ulysses , in the Heroides of Ovid , l. 10 , and the Note in Bohn \u2019 s English Translation . ]\u2014 Ver . 294 . This line and part of the next are supposed to have been translated almost literally from some lines , the composition of Menander , which are still extant . ]\u2014 Ver . 310 . Colman has the following remark : \u201c Here we enter upon the other part of the table , which the Poet has most artfully complicated with the main subject by making Syrus bring Clitipho \u2019 s mistress along with Antiphila . This part of the story , we know , was not in Menander .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 337 . As to his own mistress . ]\u2014 Ver . 342 . \u201c In aurem utramvis ,\u201d a proverbial expression , implying an easy and secure repose . It is also used by Plautus , and is found in a fragment of the \u03a0\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03b9\u1f78\u03bd , or Necklace , a Comedy of Menander . ]\u2014 Ver . 346 . \u201c Perge porro , tamen istue ago .\u201d Stallbaum observes that the meaning is : \u201c Although I \u2019 m going off , I \u2019 m still attending to what you \u2019 re saying .\u201d According to Schmieder and others , it means : \u201c Call on just as you please , I shall persist in sending Bacchis away .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 363 . \u201c Quos ,\u201d literally , \u201c What persons !\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 372 . \u201c Inversa verba , eversas cervices tuas .\u201d \u201c Inversa verba \u201d clearly means , words with a double meaning , or substituted for others by previous arrangement , like correspondence by cipher . Lucretius uses the words in this sense , B. i ., l. 643 . A full account of the secret signs and correspondence in use among the ancients will be found in the 16th and 17th Epistles of the Heroides of Ovid , in his Amours , B. i ., El . 4 , and in various passages of the Art of Love . See also the Asinaria of Plautus , l. 780 . It is not known for certain what \u201c eversa cervix \u201d here means ; it may mean the turning of the neck in some particular manner by way of a hint or to give a sidelong look , or it may allude to the act of snatching a kiss on the sly , which might lead to a discovery . ]\u2014 Ver . 393 . \u201c Cujus \u2014 hi ;\u201d a change of number by the use of the figure Enallage . ]\u2014 Ver . 400 . Colman has the following remark on this passage : \u201c Madame Dacier , contrary to the authority of all editions and MSS ., adopts a conceit of her father \u2019 s in this place , and places this speech to Clitipho , whom she supposes to have retired to a hiding-place , where he might overhear the conversation , and from whence he peeps out to make this speech to Syrus . This she calls an agreeable jeu de th\u00e9\u00e2tre , and doubts not but all lovers of Terence will be obliged to her father for so ingenious a remark ; but it is to be feared that critical sagacity will not be so lavish of acknowledgments as filial piety . There does not appear the least foundation for this remark in the Scene , nor has the Poet given us the least room to doubt of Clitipho being actually departed . To me , instead of an agreeable { jeu de th\u00e9\u00e2tre }, it appears a most absurd and ridiculous device ; particularly vicious in this place , as it most injudiciously tends to interrupt the course of Clinia \u2019 s more interesting passion , so admirably delineated in this little Scene .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 410 . Though this is the only Play which includes more than one day in the action , it is not the only one in which the day is represented as breaking . The Amphitryon and the Curculio of Plautus commence before daybreak , and the action is carried on into the middle of the day . Madame Dacier absolutely considers it { as a fact beyond all doubt }, that the Roman Audience went home after the first two Acts of the Play , and returned for the representation of the third the next morning at daybreak . Scaliger was of the same opinion ; but it is not generally entertained by Commentators . ]\u2014 Ver . 436 . \u201c Ut essem ,\u201d literally , \u201c How I was .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 452 . \u201c Satrapa \u201d was a Persian word signifying \u201c a ruler of a province .\u201d The name was considered as synonymous with \u201c possessor of wealth almost inexhaustible .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 457 . \u201c Pytiso \u201d was the name given to the nasty practice of tasting wine , and then spitting it out ; offensive in a man , but infinitely more so in a woman . It seems in those times to have been done by persons who wished to give themselves airs in the houses of private persons ; at the present day it is probably confined to wine-vaults and sale-rooms where wine is put up to auction , and even there it is practiced much more than is either necessary or agreeable . Doubtless Bacchis did it to show her exquisite taste in the matter of wines . ]\u2014 Ver . 458 . \u201c Asperum ;\u201d meaning that the wine was not old enough for her palate . The great fault of the Greek wines was their tartness , for which reason sea-water was mixed with them all except the Chian , which was the highest class of wine . ]\u2014 Ver . 459 . \u201c Pater ,\u201d literally \u201c father ;\u201d a title by which the young generally addressed aged persons who were strangers to them . ]\u2014 Ver . 460 . \u201c Dolia omnia , omnes serias .\u201d The finer kinds of wine were drawn off from the \u201c dolia ,\u201d or large vessels , into the \u201c amphor\u00e6 ,\u201d which , like the \u201c dolia ,\u201d were made of earth , and sometimes of glass . The mouths of the vessels were stopped tight by a plug of wood or cork , which was made impervious to the atmosphere by being rubbed over with a composition of pitch , clay , wax , or gypsum . On the outside , the title of the wine was painted , and among the Romans the date of the vintage was denoted by the names of the Consuls then in office . When the vessels were of glass , small tickets or labels , called \u201c pittacia ,\u201d were suspended from them , stating to a similar effect . The \u201c seri\u00e6 \u201d were much the same as the \u201c dolia ,\u201d perhaps somewhat smaller ; they were both long , bell-mouthed vessels of earthen-ware , formed of the best clay , and lined with pitch while hot from the furnace . \u201c Seri\u00e6 \u201d were also used to contain oil and other liquids ; and in the Captivi of Plautus the word is applied to pans used for the purpose of salting meat . \u201c Relino \u201d signifies the act of taking the seal of pitch or wax off the stopper of the wine-vessel . ]\u2014 Ver . 473 . Dromo . ]\u2014 Ver . 482 . \u201c Fenestram ;\u201d literally , \u201c a window .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 491 . Colman has the following Note here : \u201c Hedelin obstinately contends from this passage , that neither Chremes nor any of his family went to bed the whole night ; the contrary of which is evident , as Menage observes , from the two next Scenes . For why should Syrus take notice of his being up so early , if he had never retired to rest ? Or would Chremes have reproached Clitipho for his behavior the night before , had the feast never been interrupted ? Eugraphius \u2019 s interpretation of these words is natural and obvious , who explains them to signify that the anxiety of Chremes to restore Clinia to Menedemus broke his rest .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 511 . Madame Dacier observes that Chremes seizes this as a very plausible and necessary pretense to engage Menedemus to return home , and not to his labors in the field , as he had at first intended . ]\u2014 Ver . 521 . This was a proverbial expression , signifying a hale and vigorous old age . It has been suggested , too , that it alludes to the practice of some old men , who drink more than they eat . It was vulgarly said that eagles never die of old age , and that when , by reason of their beaks growing inward , they are unable to feed upon their prey , they live by sucking the blood . ]\u2014 Ver . 524 . Syrus , by showing himself an admirer of the good old times , a \u201c laudator temporis acti ,\u201d is wishful to flatter the vanity of Chremes , as it is a feeling common to old age , perhaps by no means an unamiable one , to think former times better than the present . Aged people feel grateful to those happy hours when their hopes were bright , and every thing was viewed from the sunny side of life . ]\u2014 Ver . 544 . He refers to Menedemus and Bacchis . ]\u2014 Ver . 555 . \u201c Sed si quid , ne quid .\u201d An instance of Aposiopesis , signifying \u201c But if any thing does happen , don \u2019 t you blame me .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 557 . Some suppose that this is said in apparent candor by Syrus , in order the more readily to throw Chremes off his guard . Other Commentators , again , fancy these words to be said by Syrus in a low voice , aside , which seems not improbable ; it being a just retribution on Chremes for his recommendation , however well intended : in that case , Chremes probably overhears it , if we may judge from his answer . ]\u2014 Ver . 568 . \u201c Factum .\u201d \u201c Done for \u201d is anothor translation which this word will here admit of . ]\u2014 Ver . 577 . Clinia . ]\u2014 Ver . 580 . This is said ironically . ]\u2014 Ver . 583 . And that an immodest one . ]\u2014 Ver . 604 . Madame Dacier remarks , that as Antiphila is shortly to be acknowledged as the daughter of Chremes , she is not therefore in company with the other women at the feast , who are Courtesans , but with the wife of Chremes , and consequently free from reproach or scandal . ]\u2014 Ver . 606 . The question of Chremes seems directed to the fact whether the girl is of value sufficient to be good security for the thousand drachm\u00e6 . ]\u2014 Ver . 612 . Madame Dacier suggests that Chremes is prevented by his wife \u2019 s coming from making a proposal to advance the money himself , on the supposition that it will be a lucrative speculation . This notion is contradicted by Colman , who adds the following note from Eugraphius : \u201c Syrus pretends to have concerted this plot against Menedemus , in order to trick him out of some money to be given to Clinia \u2019 s supposed mistress . Chremes , however , does not approve of this : yet it serves to carry on the plot ; for when Antiphila proves afterward to be the daughter of Chremes , he necessarily becomes the debtor of Bacchis , and is obliged to lay down the sum for which he imagines his daughter is pledged .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 628 . He alludes to Clitipho , who , by the discovery of his sister , would not come in for such a large share of his father \u2019 s property , and would consequently , as Syrus observes , gain a loss . ]\u2014 Ver . 652 . Madame Dacier observes upon this passage , that the ancients thought themselves guilty of a heinous offense if they suffered their children to die without having bestowed on them some of their property ; it was consequently the custom of the women , before exposing children , to attach to them some jewel or trinket among their clothes , hoping thereby to avoid incurring the guilt above mentioned , and to ease their consciences . ]\u2014 Ver . 653 . Madame Dacier says that the meaning of this passage is this : Chremes tells his wife that by having given this ring , she has done two good acts instead of one \u2014 she has both cleared her conscience and saved the child ; for had there been no ring or token exposed with the infant , the finder would not have been at the trouble of taking care of it , but might have left it to perish , never suspecting it would be inquired after , or himself liberally rewarded for having preserved it . ]\u2014 Ver . 659 . Syrus is now alarmed that Antiphila should so soon be acknowledged as the daughter of Chremes , lest he may lose the opportunity of obtaining the money , and be punished as well , in case the imposition is detected , and Bacchis discovered to be the mistress of Clitipho and not of Clinia . ]\u2014 Ver . 666 . This he says by way of palliating the cruelty he was guilty of in his orders to have the child put to death . ]\u2014 Ver . 668 . \u201c Nisi me animus fallit .\u201d He comically repeats the very same words with which Sostrata commenced in the last Scene . ]\u2014 Ver . 668 . \u201c Infortunium !\u201d was the name by which the slaves commonly denoted a beating . Colman has the following remark here : \u201c Madame Dacier , and most of the later critics who have implicitly followed her , tell us that in the interval between the third and fourth Acts , Syrus has been present at the interview between Chremes and Antiphila within . The only difficulty in this doctrine is how to reconcile it to the apparent ignorance of Syrus , which he discovers at the entrance of Clinia . But this objection , says she , is easily answered . Syrus having partly heard Antiphila \u2019 s story , and finding things likely to take an unfavorable turn , retires to consider what is best to be done . But surely this is a most unnatural impatience at so critical a conjuncture ; and , after all , would it not be better to take up the matter just where Terence has left it , and to suppose that Syrus knew nothing more of the affair than what might be collected from the late conversation between Chremes and Sostrata , at which we know he was present ? This at once accounts for his apprehensions , which he betrayed even during that Scene , as well as for his imperfect knowledge of the real state of the case , till apprised of the whole by Clinia .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 673 . He most probably alludes to the custom of tying up the slaves by their hands , after stripping them naked , when of course their \u201c latera \u201d or \u201c sides \u201d would be exposed , and come in for a share of the lashes . ]\u2014 Ver . 678 . \u201c Fugitivum argentum .\u201d Madame Dacier suggests that this is a bad translation of the words of Menander , which were \u201c \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u1f73\u03c8\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03b4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u1f73\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u03c7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u1f78\u03bd \u201d where \u201c \u03c7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u1f78\u03c2 \u201d signified both \u201c gold \u201d and the name of a slave . ]\u2014 Ver . 719 . He means those who create unnecessary difficulties in their imagination . Colman quotes the following remark from Patrick : \u201c There is a remarkable passage in Arrian \u2019 s Account of Alexander , lib . iv ., where he tells us that some embassadors from the Celtic , being asked by Alexander what in the world they dreaded most , answered , \u2018 That they feared lest the sky should fall\u2019 Alexander , who expected to hear himself named , was surprised at an answer which signified that they thought themselves beyond the reach of all human power , plainly implying that nothing could hurt them , unless he would suppose impossibilities , or a total destruction of nature .\u201d Aristotle , in his Physics , B . iv ., informs us that it was the early notion of ignorant nations that the sky was supported on the shoulders of Atlas , and that when he let go of it , it would fall . ]\u2014 Ver . 723 . \u201c Satis pol proterve ,\u201d & c. C. L\u00e6lius was said to have assisted Terence in the composition of his Plays , and in confirmation of this , the following story is told by Cornelius Nepos : \u201c C . L\u00e6lius , happening to pass the Matronaliaat his villa near Puteoli , was told that dinner was waiting , but still neglected the summons . At last , when he made his appearance , he excused himself by saying that he had been in a particular vein of composition , and quoted certain lines which occur in the Heautontimorumenos , namely , those beginning \u2018 Satis pol proterve me Syri promissa huc induxerunt .\u2019\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 730 . \u201c Dormiunt .\u201d This is clearly used figuratively , though Hedelin interprets it literally . ]\u2014 Ver . 732 . Cooke suggests that the Poet makes Bacchis call the house of Charinus \u201c villa ,\u201d and that of Chremes \u201c fundus \u201d, for the purpose of exalting the one and depreciating the other in the hearing of Syrus . ]\u2014 Ver . 733 . This passage goes far to prove that the Dionysia here mentioned as being celebrated , were those \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4 \u1fbd \u1f00\u03b3\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 , or the \u201c rural Dionysia .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 742 . Colman here remarks to the following effect : \u201c There is some difficulty in this and the next speech in the original , and the Commentators have been puzzled to make sense of them . It seems to me that the Poet \u2019 s intention is no more than this : Bacchis expresses some reluctance to act under the direction of Syrus , but is at length prevailed on , finding that he can by those means contrive to pay her the money which he has promised her .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 796 . Cicero mentions the same proverb in his work De Officiis , B. i ., ch . 10 , substituting the word \u201c injuria \u201d for \u201c malitia .\u201d \u201c\u2018 Extreme law , extreme injustice ,\u2019 is now become a stale proverb in discourse .\u201d The same sentiment is found in the Fragments of Menander . ]\u2014 Ver . 839 . He inveighs , perhaps justly , against the tyranny of custom ; but in selecting this occasion for doing so , he does not manifest any great affection for his newly-found daughter . ]\u2014 Ver . 875 . The three terms here used are borrowed from the stage . \u201c Adjutor \u201d was the person who assisted the performers either by voice or gesture ; \u201c monitor \u201d was the prompter ; and \u201c pr\u00e6monstrator \u201d was the person who in the rehearsal trained the actor in his part . ]\u2014 Ver . 877 . There is a similar passage in the Bacchides of Plautus , l. 1087 . \u201c Whoever there are in any place whatsoever , whoever have been , and whoever shall be in time to come , fools , blockheads , idiots , dolts , sots , oafs , lubbers , I singly by far exceed them all in folly and absurd ways .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 887 . He means that Syrus not only lays his plots well , but teaches the performers to put on countenances suitable to the several parts they are to act . ]\u2014 Ver . 898 . \u201c Mire finxit .\u201d He sarcastically uses the same word , \u201c fingo ,\u201d which Chremes himself employed in l . 887 . ]\u2014 Ver . 909 . \u201c Familia \u201d here means \u201c property ,\u201d as producing sustenance . Colman , however , has translated the passage : \u201c Mine is scarce a ten-days \u2019 family .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 911 . Menedemus speaks of \u201c amico ,\u201d a male friend , which Chremes plays upon by saying \u201c amicae ,\u201d which literally meant a she-friend , and was the usual name by which decent people called a mistress . ]\u2014 Ver . 924 . Madame Dacier observes here , that one of the great beauties of this Scene consists in Chremes retorting on Menedemus the very advice given by himself at the beginning of the Play . ]\u2014 Ver . 954 . Colman has the following Note : \u201c The departure of Menedemus here is very abrupt , seeming to be in the midst of a conversation ; and his re-entrance with Clitipho , already supposed to be apprised of what has passed between the two old gentlemen , is equally precipitate . Menage imagines that some verses are lost here . Madame Dacier strains hard to defend the Poet , and fills up the void of time by her old expedient of making the Audience wait to see Chremes walk impatiently to and fro , till a sufficient time is elapsed for Menedemus to have given Clitipho a summary account of the cause of his father \u2019 s anger . The truth is , that a too strict observance of the unity of place will necessarily produce such absurdities ; and there are several other instances of the like nature in Terence .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 966 . This is an early instance of a trusteeship and a guardianship . ]\u2014 Ver . 974 . \u201c Ilicet ,\u201d literally , \u201c you may go away .\u201d This was the formal word with which funeral ceremonies and trials at law were concluded . ]\u2014 Ver . 975 . He alludes to the practice of slaves taking refuge at altars when they had committed any fault , and then suing for pardon through a \u201c precator \u201d or \u201c mediator .\u201d See the Mostellaria of Plautus , l. 1074 , where Tranio takes refuge at the altar from the vengeance of his master , Theuropides . ]\u2014 Ver . 1010 . \u201c Quam quidem redit ad integrum eadem oratio ;\u201d meaning , \u201c it amounts to one and the same thing ,\u201d or , \u201c it is all the same thing ,\u201d whether you do or whether you don \u2019 t know . ]\u2014 Ver . 1018 . This sentence has given much trouble to the Commentators . Colman has the following just remarks upon it : \u201c Madame Dacier , as well as all the rest of the Commentators , has stuck at these words . Most of them imagine she means to say , that the discovery of Antiphila is a plain proof that she is not barren . Madame Dacier supposes that she intimates such a proof to be easy , because Clitipho and Antiphila were extremely alike ; which sense she thinks immediately confirmed by the answer of Chremes . I can not agree with any of them , and think that the whole difficulty of the passage here , as in many other places , is entirely of their own making . Sostrata could not refer to the reply of Chremes , because she could not possibly tell what it would be ; but her own speech is intended as an answer to his preceding one , which she takes as a sneer on her late wonderful discovery of a daughter ; imagining that he means to insinuate that she could at any time with equal ease make out the proofs of the birth of her son . The elliptical mode of expression so usual with Terence , together with the refinements of Commentators , seem to have created all the obscurity .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 1036 . It is probably this ebullition of Comic anger which is referred to by Horace , in his Art of Poetry : \u201c Interdum tamen et vocem Com\u0153dia tollit , Iratusque Chremes tumido delitigat ore :\u201d \u201c Yet sometimes Comedy as well raises her voice , and enraged Chremes censures in swelling phrase .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 1037 . \u201c Deos nescio .\u201d The Critic Lambinis , in his letter to Charles the Ninth of France , accuses Terence of impiety in this passage . Madame Dacier has , however , well observed , that the meaning is not \u201c I care not for the Gods ,\u201d but \u201c I know not what the Gods will do .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 1048 . \u201c Firmas .\u201d This ratification or affirmation would be made by Menedemus using the formal word \u201c Accipio ,\u201d \u201c I accept .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 1060 . Many take \u201c sparso ore \u201d here to mean \u201c wide-mouthed .\u201d Lemonnier thinks that must be the meaning , as he has analyzed the other features of her countenance . There is , however , no reason why he should not speak of her complexion ; and it seems , not improbably , to have the same meaning as the phrase \u201c os lentiginosum ,\u201d \u201c a freckled face .\u201d] * * * * ADELPHI ; THE BROTHERS , DRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6 .

Colman has the following Note : \u201c A famous Comic Poet among the Romans . His chief excellences are said to have been , the gravity of his style and the choice of his subjects . The first quality was attributed to him by Horace , Tully , etc ., and the last by Varro . \u2018 In argumentis C\u00e6cilius poscit palmam , in ethesi Terentius .\u2019 \u2018 In the choice of subjects , C\u00e6cilius demands the preference ; in the manners , Terence .\u2019\u201d Madame Dacier , indeed , renders \u201c in argumentis ,\u201d \u201c in the disposition of his subjects .\u201d But the words will not bear that construction . \u201c Argumentum ,\u201d I believe , is uniformly used for the argument itself , and never implies the conduct of it ; as in the Prologue to the Andrian , \u201c non tam dissimili argumento .\u201d Besides , the disposition of the subject was the very art attributed by the critics of those days to Terence , and which Horace mentions in the very same line with the gravity of C\u00e6cilius , distinguishing them as the several characteristics of each writer , \u201c Vincere C\u00e6cilius gravitate , Terentius arte .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 33 . Horace probably had this passage in his mind when he penned the First Epistle in his Second Book , l. 185 ; where he mentions the populace leaving a Play in the midst for the sight of a bear , or an exhibition of boxers . ]\u2014 Ver . 34 . The art of dancing on the tight rope was carried to great perfection among the ancients . Many paintings have been discovered , which show the numerous attitudes which the performers assumed . The figures have their heads enveloped in skins or caps , probably intended as a protection in case of falling . At the conclusion of the performance the dancer ran down the rope .

This was in consequence of their sitting indiscriminately at the Amphitheatre , where the gladiators were exhibited ; whereas at the Theatres there were distinct places appropriated to each \u201c ordo \u201d or class . ]\u2014 Ver . 45 . Madame Dacier remarks that there is great force and eloquence in the Actor \u2019 s affecting a concern for the sacred festivals , which were in danger of being deprived of their chief ornaments , if by too great a severity they discouraged the Poets who undertook to furnish the Plays during the solemnity . ]\u2014 Ver . 57 . It is generally supposed that \u201c meo pretio \u201d means \u201c a price named as my estimate ;\u201d and that it was the custom for the \u00c6diles to purchase a Play of a Poet at a price fixed by the head of the company of actors . It is also thought that the money was paid to the actor , who handed over the whole , or a certain part , to the Poet , and if the Play was not received with favor , the \u00c6diles had the right to ask back the money from the actor , who consequently became a loser by the transaction . Pareus and Meric Casaubon think , however , that in case of this Play , the \u00c6diles had purchased it from the Poet , and the performers had bought it of the \u00c6diles as a speculation . What he means at the end of the First Prologue by selling the Play over again , is not exactly known . Perhaps if the Play had been then performed throughout and received with no favor , he would have had to forfeit the money , and lose all right to any future pecuniary interest in it ; but he preferred to cancel the whole transaction , and to reserve the Play for purchase and representation at a more favorable period . ]\u2014 This is a protatic character , or one that helps to introduce the subject of the Play , and then appears no more . ]\u2014 Ver . 109 . She says this ironically , at the same time intimating that she knows Parmeno too well , not to be sure that he is as impatient to impart the secret to her as she is to know it . Donatus remarks , that she pretends she has no curiosity to hear it , that he may deem her the more worthy to be intrusted with the secret . ]\u2014 Ver . 171 .

Here Philotis gives a reason , as Donatus observes , why she does not again appear in the Play . The following is an extract from Colman \u2019 s remarks on this passage : \u201c It were to be wished , for the sake of the credit of our author \u2019 s acknowledged { art } in the Drama , that Philotis had assigned as good a reason for her appearing at all . Eugraphius justly says : \u2018 The Courtesan in this Scene is a character quite foreign to the fable .\u2019 Donatus also says much the same thing in his Preface , and in his first Note to this Comedy ; but adds that \u2018 Terence chose this method rather than to relate the argument by means of a Prologue , or to introduce a God speaking from a machine . I will venture to say that the Poet might have taken a much shorter and easier method than either ; I mean , to have begun the Play with the very Scene which now opens the Second Act .\u2019\u201d]\u2014 Colman has the following observations on this Scene : \u201c Donatus remarks that this Scene opens the intention of Terence to oppose the generally-received opinion , and to draw the character of a good step-mother . It would , therefore , as has been already observed , have been a very proper Scene to begin the Play , as it carries us immediately into the midst of things ; and we can not fail to be interested when we see the persons acting so deeply interested themselves . We gather from it just so much of the story as is necessary for our information at first setting out . We are told of the abrupt departure of Philumena , and are witnesses of the confusion in the two families of Laches and Phidippus . The absence of Laches , which had been in great measure the occasion of this misunderstanding , is also very artfully mentioned in the altercation between him and Sostrata . The character of Laches is very naturally drawn . He has a good heart , and a testy disposition , and the poor old gentleman is kept in such constant perplexity that he has perpetual occasion to exert both those qualities .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 212 . The plural \u201c liberos ,\u201d children , is used where only one is being spoken of , similarly , in the Heautontimorumenos , l . 151 . ]\u2014 Ver . 262 . Donatus observes that the Poet shows his art in here preparing a reason to be assigned by Pamphilus for his pretended discontent at the departure of his wife . ]\u2014 Ver . 271 . Colman observes on this passage : \u201c This is extremely artful . The answer of Philumena , as related by Phidippus , contains an ample vindication of Pamphilus . What , then , can we suppose could make the house so disagreeable to her in his absence , but the behavior of Sostrata ? She declares her innocence ; yet appearances are all against her . Supposing this to be the first Act of the Play , it would be impossible for a Comedy to open in a more interesting manner .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 314 . It was the custom with the Greeks and Romans , when returning from abroad , to send a messenger before them , to inform their wives of their arrival . ]\u2014 Ver . 321 . \u201c Pavitare .\u201d Casaubon has a curious suggestion here ; he thinks it not improbable that he had heard the female servants whispering among themselves that Philumena \u201c paritare ,\u201d \u201c was about to be brought to bed ,\u201d which he took for \u201c pavitare ,\u201d \u201c was in fear \u201d of something . ]\u2014 Ver . 335 . Probably meaning that he will be examined by torture , whether he has not , by drugs or other means , contributed to Philumena \u2019 s illness . ]\u2014 Ver . 338 . She invokes \u00c6sculapius , the God of Medicine , and \u201c Salus ,\u201d or \u201c Health ,\u201d because , in Greece , their statues were always placed near each other ; so that to have offered prayers to one and not to the other , would have been deemed a high indignity . On the worship of \u00c6sculapius , see the opening Scene of the Curculio of Plautus . ]\u2014 Ver . 357 . \u201c Quotidiana ;\u201d literally , \u201c daily .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 369 . This must have been imaginary , as they were not likely to be acquainted with the reason of Philumena \u2019 s apprehensions . ]\u2014 Ver . 394 . There is great doubt what is the exact meaning of \u201c postquam ad te venit ,\u201d here ,\u2014 whether it means , \u201c it is now the seventh month since she became your wife ,\u201d or , \u201c it is now the seventh month since she came to your embraces ,\u201d which did not happen for two months after the marriage . The former is , under the circumstances , the most probable construction . ]\u2014 Ver . 401 . Colman very justly observes here : \u201c it is rather extraordinary that Myrrhina \u2019 s account of the injury done to her daughter should not put Pamphilus in mind of his own adventure , which comes out in the Fifth Act . It is certain that had the Poet let the Audience into that secret in this place , they would have immediately concluded that the wife of Pamphilus and the lady whom he had ravished were one and the same person .\u201d Playwrights have never , in any age or country , troubled themselves much about probability in their plots . Besides , his adventure with Philumena was by no means an uncommon one . We find similar instances mentioned by Plautus ; and violence and debauchery seem almost to have reigned paramount in the streets at night . ]\u2014 Ver . 421 . In his voyage from Imbros to Athens , namely , which certainly appears to have been unusually long . ]\u2014 Ver . 431 . This was the fort or citadel that defended the Pir\u00e6us , and being three miles distant from the city , was better suited for the design of Pamphilus , whose object it was to keep Parmeno for some time at a distance . ]\u2014 Ver . 435 . He facetiously pretends to think that Pamphilus may , during a storm at sea , have vowed to walk him to death , if he should return home . ]\u2014 Ver . 448 . Colman observes here : \u201c This reflection seems to be rather improper in this place , for the discovery of Philumena \u2019 s labor betrayed to Pamphilus the real motive of her departure ; after which discovery his anxiety proceeds entirely from the supposed injury offered him , and his filial piety is from that period made use of merely as a pretense .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 461 . This is living well in the sense used by the \u201c Friar of orders gray .\u201d \u201c Who leads a good life is sure to live well .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 462 . Colman remarks that this passage is taken notice of by Donatus as a particularly happy stroke of character ; and indeed the idea of a covetous old man gaping for a fat legacy , and having his mouth stopped by a moral precept , is truly comic . ]\u2014 Ver . 502 . As was universally done on a separation by agreement . ]\u2014 Ver . 531 . Lemaire observes that , from this passage , it would appear that the Greeks considered seven months sufficient for gestation . So it would appear , if we are to take the time of the Play to be seven , and not nine , months after the marriage ; and , as before observed , the former seems to be the more reasonable conclusion . ]\u2014 Ver . 574 . Colman remarks that this preparation for the catastrophe by the mention of the ring , is not so artful as might have been expected from Terence ; as in this soliloquy he tells the circumstances directly to the Audience . ]\u2014 Ver . 592 . \u201c Festos dies .\u201d The days for sacrificing to particular Divinities , when she would have the opportunity of meeting her friends , and making herself merry with them . ]\u2014 Ver . 596 . Colman says : \u201c This idea of the long life of a step-mother being odious to her family , is applied in a very beautiful and uncommon manner by Shakspeare :\u2014 \u201c Now , fair Hippolyta , our nuptial hour Draws on apace ; for happy days bring in Another morn ; but oh , methinks how slow This old morn wanes ! she lingers my desires Like to a step-dame , or a dowager , Long withering out a young man \u2019 s revenue .\u201d Midsummer Night \u2019 s Dream . ]\u2014 Ver . 621 . \u201c Senex atque anus .\u201d In these words he probably refers to the commencement of many of the stories current in those times , which began : \u201c There were once upon a time an old man and an old woman .\u201d Indeed , almost the same words occur in the Stichus of Plautus , l. 540 , at the commencement of a story : \u201c Fuit olim , quasi ego sum , senex ,\u201d \u201c There was upon a time an old man , just like me .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 638 . In cases of separation it was customary for the father to have the care of the male children . ]\u2014 Ver . 725 . Donatus observes that Phidippus utters these words with an air of disinclination to be present at the conference ; and , indeed , the characters are well sustained , as it would not become him coolly to discourse with a courtesan , whom he supposes to have alienated Pamphilus from his daughter , although he might very properly advise it , as being likely to conduce to the peace of both families . ]\u2014 Ver . 752 . Colman observes , how are we to reconcile this with the words of Parmeno at the beginning of the Play , where he says that Pamphilus visited Bacchis daily ; and he inquires whether we are to suppose that Bacchis , who behaves so candidly in every other instance , wantonly perjures herself in this , or that the Poet , by a strange infatuation attending him in this Play , contradicts himself ? To this it may be answered , that as Bacchis appears to be so scrupulous in other instances , it is credible that , notwithstanding his visits , she may not have allowed him to share her embraces . ]\u2014 Ver . 777 . Colman has the following quotation from Donatus : \u201c Terence , by his uncommon art , has attempted many innovations with great success . In this Comedy , he introduces , contrary to received prejudices , a good step-mother and an honest courtesan ; but at the same time he so carefully assigns their motives of action , that by him alone every thing seems reconcilable to truth and nature ; for this is just the opposite of what he mentions in another place , as the common privilege of all Poets , \u2018 to paint good matrons and wicked courtesans .\u2019\u201d Perhaps the same good feeling prompted Terence , in showing that a mother-in-law and a courtesan could be capable of acting with good and disinterested feelings , which caused Cumberland to write his Play of \u201c The Jew ,\u201d to combat the popular prejudice against that persecuted class , by showing , in the character of Sheva , that a Jew might possibly be a virtuous man . ]\u2014 Ver . 778 . The words here employed are also capable of meaning , if an active sense is given to \u201c suspectas ,\u201d \u201c our wives have entertained wrong suspicions ;\u201d but the sense above given seems preferable , as being the meaning of the passage . ]\u2014 Ver . 809 . Donatus remarks , that Parmeno is drawn as being of a lazy and inquisitive character ; and that Terence , therefore , humorously contrives to keep him always on the move , and in total ignorance of what is going on . ]\u2014 Ver . 824 . Cooke has this remark here : \u201c I suppose that this is the best excuse the Poet could make for the young gentleman \u2019 s being guilty of felony and rape at the same time . In this speech , the incident is related on which the catastrophe of the Play turns , which incident is a very barbarous one , and attended with more than one absurdity , though it is the occasion of an agreeable discovery .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 867 .\u2014 Madame Dacier observes on this passage : \u201c Terence here , with reason , endeavors to make the most of a circumstance peculiar to his Play . In other Comedies , every body , Actors as well as Spectators , are at last equally acquainted with the whole intrigue and catastrophe , and it would even be a defect in the plot were there any obscurity remaining . But Terence , like a true genius , makes himself superior to rules , and adds new beauties to his piece by forsaking them . His reasons for concealing from part of the personages of the Drama the principal incident of the plot , are so plausible and natural , that he could not have followed the beaten track without offending against manners and decency . This bold and uncommon turn is one of the chief graces of the Play .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 876 . Parmeno says this , while pondering upon the meaning of all that is going on , and thereby expresses his impatience to become acquainted with it . He therefore repeats what Pamphilus has before said in the twelfth line of the present Act , about his having been restored from death to life by his agency . ]\u2014 Ver . 881 . We may here remark , that the Hecyra is the only one of the Plays of Terence with a single plot . ] * * * *", "Why so ?", "Be of good heart ; { only } approach this fire ,you \u2019 ll soon be warmer than you need .

He refused at first . But on his father pressing more urgently , he caused him to become wavering in his mind , whether to yield rather to duty or to love . By hammering on and teazing him , at last the old man gained his point ; and betrothed him to the daughter of our next-door neighbor hereThis did not seem so very disagreeable to Pamphilus , until on the very point of marriage , when he saw that all was ready , and that no respite was granted , but marry he must ; then , at last , he took it so much to heart , that I do believe if Bacchis had been present , { even } she would have pitied him .

As for myself , in consequence of my son not having returned home , what do I imagine ? In what ways am I not disturbed ? For fear lest he may either have taken cold ,or have fallen down somewhere , or have broken some { limb }. Oh dear ! that any man should take it into his head , or find out what is dearer { to him } than he is to himself ! And yet he is not my son , but my brother \u2019 s . He is quite different in disposition . I , from my very youth upward , have lived a comfortable town life , and { taken } my ease ; and , what they esteem a piece of luck , I have never had a wife . He , on the contrary to all this , has spent his life in the country , { and } has always lived laboriously and penuriously . He married a wife , { and } has two sons . This one , the elder of them , I have adopted . I have brought him up from an infant , { and } considered { and } loved him as my own . In him I centre my delight ; this { object } alone is dear to me . On the other hand , I take all due care that he may hold me equally dear . I give \u2014 I overlook ; I do not judge it necessary to exert my authority in every thing ; in fine , the things that youth prompts to , { and } that others do unknown to their fathers , I have used my son not to conceal from me . For he , who , as the practice is , will dare to tell a lie to or to deceive his father , will still more dare { to do so } to others . I think it better to restrain children through a sense of shame and liberal treatment , than through fear . On these points my brother does not agree with me , nor do they please him . He often comes to me exclaiming , \u201c What are you about , Micio ? Why do you ruin for us this youth ? Why does he intrigue ? Why does he drink ? Why do you supply him with the means for these goings on ? You indulge him with too much dress ; you are very inconsiderate .\u201d He himself is too strict , beyond what is just and reasonable ; and he is very much mistaken , in my opinion , at all events , who thinks that an authority is more firm or more lasting which is established by force , than that which is founded on affection . Such is my mode of reasoning ; and thus do I persuade myself . He , who , compelled by harsh treatment , does his duty , so long as he thinks it will be known , is on his guard : if he hopes that it will be concealed , he again returns to his natural bent . He whom you have secured by kindness , acts from inclination ; he is anxious to return like for like ; present and absent , he will be the same . This is the duty of a parent , to accustom a son to do what is right rather of his own choice , than through fear of another . In this the father differs from the master : he who can not do this , let him confess that he does not know how to govern children . But is not this the very man of whom I was speaking ? Surely it is he . I don \u2019 t know why it is I see him out of spirits ; I suppose he \u2019 ll now be scolding as usual . Demea , I am glad to see you well .", "I am glad of it .", "How is this ? What has so suddenly changed your disposition , { Demea }? What caprice { is this }? What means this sudden liberality ?", "I know it .", "That \u2019 s right .Grant us your applause . FOOTNOTES\u2014 This Playwas performed at the Funeral Games of Lucius \u00c6milius Paulus , who was surnamed Macedonicus , from having gained a victory over Perseus , King of Macedon . He was so poor at the time of his decease , that they were obliged to sell his estate in order to pay his widow her dower . The Q. Fabius Maximus and P. Cornelius Africanus here mentioned were not , as some have thought , the Curale \u00c6diles , but two sons of \u00c6milius Paulus , who had taken the surnames of the families into which they had been adopted . ]\u2014 The \u201c Sarranian \u201d or \u201c Tyrian \u201d pipes , or flutes , are supposed to have been of a quick and mirthful tone ; Madame Dacier has consequently with much justice suggested that the representation being on the occasion of a funeral , the title has not come down to us in a complete form , and that it was performed with the Lydian , or grave , solemn pipe , alternately with the Tyrian . This opinion is also strengthened by the fact that Donatus expressly says that it was performed to the music of Lydian flutes . ]\u2014 L. Anicius Gallus and M. Cornelius Cethegus were Consuls in the year from the Building of the City 592 , and B. C . 161 . ]\u2014 Ver . 6 . Signifying \u201c persons dying together .\u201d The \u201c Commorientes \u201d of Plautus is lost . It has been doubted by some , despite these words of Terence , if Plautus ever did write such a Play . ]\u2014 Ver . 6 . Diphilus was a Greek Poet , contemporary with Menander . ]\u2014 Ver . 20 . According to Donatus , by the words \u201c in bello ,\u201d Terence is supposed to refer to his friend and patron Scipio ; by \u201c in otio ,\u201d to Furius Publius ; and in the words \u201c in negotio \u201d to L\u00e6lius , who was famed for his wisdom . ]\u2014 Ver . 23 . This is similar to the words in the Prologue to the Trinummus of Plautus , l. 16 : \u201c But expect nothing about the plot of this Play ; the old men who will come hither will disclose the matter to you .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 24 . \u201c Advorsum ierant .\u201d On the duties of the \u201c adversitores ,\u201d see the Notes to Bohn \u2019 s Translation of Plautus . ]\u2014 Ver . 36 . Westerhovius observes that this passage seems to be taken from one in the Miles Gloriosus of Plautus , l. 721 , et seq . : \u201c Troth , if I had had them , enough anxiety should I have had from my children ; I should have been everlastingly tormented in mind : but if perchance one had had a fever , I think I should have died . Or if one in liquor had tumbled any where from his horse , I should have been afraid that he had broken his legs or neck on that occasion .\u201d It may be remarked that there is a great resemblance between the characters of Micio here and Periplecomenus in the Miles Gloriosus . ]\u2014 Ver . 81 . Cooke remarks , that though there are several fine passages in this speech , and good observations on human life , yet it is too long a soliloquy . ]\u2014 Ver . 81 . Donatus observes that the Poet has in this place improved upon Menander , in representing Demea as more ready to wrangle with his brother than to return his compliments . ]\u2014 Ver . 82 . The passage pretty clearly means by \u201c ubi nobis \u00c6schinus sit ,\u201d \u201c when I \u2019 ve got such a son as \u00c6schinus .\u201d Madame Dacier , however , would translate it : \u201c Ask me \u2014 you , in whose house \u00c6schinus is ?\u201d thus accusing him of harboring \u00c6schinus ; a very forced construction , however . ]\u2014 Ver . 88 . The works of Ovid and Plautus show that it was no uncommon thing for riotous young men to break open doors ; Ovid even suggests to the lover the expediency of getting into the house through the windows . ]\u2014 Ver . 117 . Colman has the following observation here : \u201c The mild character of Micio is contrasted by Cicero to that of a furious , savage , severe father , as drawn by the famous Comic Poet , Caecilius . Both writers are quoted in the Oration for Caelias , in the composition of which it is plain that the orator kept his eye pretty closely on our Poet . The passages from Caecilius contain all that vehemence and severity , which , as Horace tells us , was accounted the common character of the style of that author .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 117 . For an account of the \u201c unguenta ,\u201d or perfumes in use among the ancients , see the Notes to Bohn \u2019 s translation of Plautus . ]\u2014 Ver . 119 . No doubt by his mistress when she has drained him of his money , and not by Micio himself , as Colman says he was once led to imagine . ]\u2014 Ver . 141 . Donatus observes here , that Terence seems inclined to favor the part of mild fathers . He represents Micio as appalled at his adopted son \u2019 s irregularities , lest if he should appear wholly unmoved , he should seem to be corrupting him , rather than to be treating him with only a proper degree of indulgence . ]\u2014 Ver . 151 . Donatus remarks here , that the art of Terence in preparing his incidents is wonderful . He contrives that even ignorant persons shall open the plot , as in the present instance , where we understand that Aeschinus has mentioned to Micio his intention of taking a wife , though he has not entered into particulars . This naturally leads us to the ensuing parts of the Play , without forestalling any of the circumstances . ]\u2014 Ver . 161 . He says this aloud , and with emphasis , relying upon the laws which were enacted at Athens in favor of the \u201c lenones ,\u201d whose occupation brought great profits to the state , from their extensive trading in slaves . It was forbidden to maltreat them , under pain of being disinherited . ]\u2014 Ver . 188 . Westerhovius supposes this part to be a translation from the works of Diphilus . ]\u2014 Ver . 194 . \u201c Asserere liberati causa ,\u201d was to assert the freedom of a person , with a determination to maintain it at law . The \u201c assertor \u201d laid hands upon the person , declaring that he or she was free ; and till the cause was tried , the person whose freedom was claimed , remained in the hands of the \u201c assertor .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 196 . Colman has a curious remark here : \u201c I do not remember , in the whole circle of modern comedy , a more natural picture of the elegant ease and indifference of a fine gentleman , than that exhibited in this Scene in the character of \u00c6schinus .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 204 . He means , that if he only names a price , \u00c6schinus will suborn witnesses to say that he has agreed to sell her , in which case \u00c6schinus will carry her off with impunity , and the laws will not allow him to recover her ; as it will then be an ordinary debt , and he will be put off with all the common excuses used by debtors . ]\u2014 Ver . 212 . \u201c Certationem comparatam .\u201d This was a term taken from the combats of gladiators , where it was usual to choose as combatants such as seemed most nearly a match for each other . ]\u2014 Ver . 217 . This passage is probably alluded to by Cicero , in his work , De Officiis B. ii . c. 18 : \u201c For it is not only liberal sometimes to give up a little of one \u2019 s rights , but it is also profitable .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 229 . \u201c Ut in ipso articulo oppressit .\u201d Colman translates this , \u201c Nick \u2019 d me to a hair .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 230 . He alludes to a famous slave-market held in the Isle of Cyprus , whither merchants carried slaves for sale , after buying them up in all parts of Greece . ]\u2014 Ver . 236 . \u201c Jamne enumerasti id quod ad te rediturum putes ?\u201d Colman renders this , \u201c Well , have you calculated what \u2019 s your due ?\u201d referring to the value of the Music-girl that has been taken away from him ; and thinks that the following conversation between Sannio and Syrus supports that construction . Madame Dacier puts another sense on the words , and understands them as alluding to Sannio \u2019 s calculation of his expected profits at Cyprus . ]\u2014 Ver . 242 . Donatus remarks , that Syrus knows very well that \u00c6schinus is ready to pay the whole , but offers Sannio half , that he may be glad to take the bare principal , and think himself well off into the bargain . ]\u2014 Ver . 265 . Donatus remarks upon the readiness with which Sannio takes the appellation of \u201c sacrilegus ,\u201d as adapted to no other person than himself . ]\u2014 Ver . 275 . Donatus tells us , that in Menander the young man was on the point of killing himself . Terence has here softened it into leaving the country . Colman remarks : \u201c We know that the circumstance of carrying off the Music-girl was borrowed from Diphilus ; yet it is plain from Donatus that there was also an intrigue by Ctesipho in the Play of Menander ; which gives another proof of the manner in which Terence used the Greek Comedies .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 278 . Donatus remarks that this is a piece of malice on the part of Syrus , for the purpose of teasing Sannio . ]\u2014 Ver . 285 . Those used for the purpose of reclining on at the entertainment . ]\u2014 Ver . 321 . Quoting from Madame Dacier , Colman has this remark here : \u201c Geta \u2019 s reply is founded on a frolicsome but ill-natured custom which prevailed in Greece \u2014 to stop the slaves in the streets , and designedly keep them in chat , so that they might be lashed when they came home for staying out so long .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 333 . It was a prevalent custom with the Greeks to place the newly-born child upon the knee of its grandfather . ]\u2014 Ver . 378 . The operation of boning conger-eels is often mentioned in Plautus , from whom we learn that they were best when eaten in that state , and cold . ]\u2014 Ver . 385 . See a similar passage in the Trinummus of Plautus , l. 722 , whence it appears that it was the practice for young men of ruined fortunes to go and offer their services as mercenaries to some of the neighboring potentates . Many of the ten thousand who fought for the younger Cyrus at the battle of Cunaxa , and were led back under the command of Xenophon , were , doubtless , of this class . ]\u2014 Ver . 428 . He parodies the words of Demea in l. 415 , where he speaks of looking into the lives of men as into a mirror . ]\u2014 Ver . 439 . Solon divided the Athenians into ten tribes , which he named after ten of the ancient heroes : Erectheis , \u00c6geis , Pandionis , Leontis , Acamantis , \u0152neis , Cecrops , Hippothoontis , \u00c6antis , and Antiochis . These tribes were each divided into ten Demi . ]\u2014 Ver . 473 .

So in the Andria , l. 473 , where Glycerium is overtaken with the pains of labor , she calls upon Juno Lucina . ]\u2014 Ver . 494 . In the Play of Menander , Hegio was the brother of Sostrata . ]\u2014 Ver . 500 . \u201c Is , quod mihi de hae re dederat consilium , id sequar .\u201d Coleman has the following Note on this passage : \u201c Madame Dacier rejects this line , because it is also to be found in the Phormio . But it is no uncommon thing with our author to use the same expression or verse for different places , especially on familiar occasions . There is no impropriety in it here , and the foregoing hemistich is rather lame without it . The propriety of consulting Micio , or Demea \u2019 s present ill-humor with him , are of no consequence . The old man is surprised at Hegio \u2019 s story , does not know what to do or say , and means to evade giving a positive answer , by saying that he would consult his brother .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 506 . \u201c Redite .\u201d Demea most probably uses this word , because Hegio has come back to him to repeat the last words for the sake of greater emphasis . ]\u2014 Ver . 512 . Colman has the following Note here : \u201c Donatus tells us , that in some old copies this whole Scene was wanting . Guyetus therefore entirely rejects it . I have not ventured to take that liberty ; but must confess that it appears to me , if not supposititious , at least cold and superfluous , and the substance of it had better been supposed to have passed between Hegio and Sostrata within .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 519 . It is very doubtful whether the words \u201c cum maxime \u201d mean to signify exactly \u201c at this moment ,\u201d or are intended to signify the intensity with which Demea is laboring . ]\u2014 Ver . 522 . Lemaire suggests that by these words Syrus intends to imply that he should not care if Demea were never to arise from his bed , but were to die there . Ctesipho , only taking him heartily to second his own wishes for the old man \u2019 s absence , answers affirmatively \u201c ita ,\u201d \u201c by all means ,\u201d \u201c exactly so .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 529 . Schmieder observes that \u201c tanto nequior \u201d might have two meanings ,\u2014 \u201c so much the worse { for us },\u201d or , as the spectators might understand it , \u201c so much the more worthless you .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 538 . This was a proverbial expression , tantamount to our saying , \u201c Talk of the devil , he \u2019 s sure to appear .\u201d Servius , in his Commentary on the Ninth Eclogue of Virgil , says that the saying arose from the common belief that the person whom a wolf sets his eyes upon is deprived of his voice , and thence came to be applied to a person who , coming upon others in the act of talking about him , necessarily put a stop to their conversation . Cooke says , in reference to this passage , \u201c This certainly alludes to a Fable of \u00c6sop \u2019 s , of the Wolf , the Fox , and the Ape : which is translated by Ph\u00e6drus , and is the tenth of his First Book .\u201d It is much more certain that Cooke is mistaken here , and that the fable of the arbitration of the Ape between the Wolf and the Fox has nothing to do with this passage . If it alludes to any fable, it is more likely to be that where the Nurse threatens that the wolf shall take the naughty Child , on which he makes his appearance , but is disappointed in his expectations , or else that of the Shepherd-boy and the Wolf . See the Stichus of Plautus , l. 57 , where the same expression occurs . ]\u2014 Ver . 542 . Donatus remarks that the Poet artfully contrives to detain Demea in town , his presence being necessary in the latter part of the Play . ]\u2014 Ver . 553 . Donatus observes that the young man was silly in this , for if discovered to be there he would be sure to be caught . His object , however , for going there would be that he might not be discovered . ]\u2014 Ver . 580 . \u201c Censen hominem me esse ?\u201d literally , \u201c Do you take me to be a human being ?\u201d meaning , \u201c Do you take me to be a person in my common senses ?\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 583 . Theobald , in his edition of Shakspeare , observes that the direction given by Lancelot in the Merchant of Venice seems to be copied from that given here by Syrus : \u201c Turn up on your right hand at the next turning , but at the next turning of all on your left ; marry , at the very next turning of no hand , but turn down indirectly to the Jew \u2019 s house .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 584 . From this we discover that Demea is being sent to the very extremity of the town , as Donatus informs us that ponds of water were always close to the gates of towns , for the purpose of watering the beasts of burden , and of having a supply at hand in case the enemy should set fire to the city gates . ]\u2014 Ver . 586 . Donatus remarks that it was usual for the Greeks to sit and drink in the sun ; and that Syrus being suddenly asked this question shows his presence of mind by giving this circumstantial answer , that he may the better impose upon Demea . The couches used on such occasions may be presumed to have required stout legs , and to be made of hard wood , such as oak , to prevent them from splitting . Two instances of couches being used for carousing in the open air will be found in the last Scenes of the Asinaria and Stichus of Plautus . ]\u2014 Ver . 588 . \u201c Silicernium .\u201d This was said to be the name of a funeral entertainment or dish of meats offered up to the \u201c umbr\u00e6 \u201d or \u201c manes ,\u201d in silence . The word is also said to have been applied to an old man from his stooping postures , \u201c silices cernit ,\u201d \u201c he looks at the stones .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 590 . \u201c Totus ,\u201d literally , \u201c quite \u201d or \u201c altogether .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 592 . As to the \u201c cyathi \u201d and cups of the ancients , see the last Scene of the Stichus of Plautus , which is a perfect specimen of a carousal among the lower classes in ancient times . See also the last Scene of the Asinaria . The slaves generally appear to have taken part in the entertainments with their young masters . ]\u2014 Ver . 606 . These lines are supposed to be founded on some verses of Menander which are still extant . ]\u2014 Ver . 655 . It appears to have been a law given by Solon to the Athenians that the next male relative of suitable age should marry a female orphan himself , or find her a suitable portion . Madame Dacier suggests that the custom was derived from the Ph\u0153nicians , who had received it from the Jews , and quotes the Book of Numbers , xxxvi . 8 . This law forms the basis of the plot of the Phormio . ]\u2014 Ver . 658 . A colony of Athens , on the coast of Asia Minor . ]\u2014 Ver . 673 . Donatus observes that these questions , which enumerate all the proofs requisite for a marriage , are an indirect and very delicate reproof of \u00c6schinus for the irregular and clandestine nature of his proceedings . ]\u2014 Ver . 707 . Donatus remarks that there is great delicacy in this compliment of \u00c6schinus to Micio , which , though made in his presence , does not bear the semblance of flattery . Madame Dacier thinks that Terence here alludes to a line of Hesiod , which says that it is the duty of the aged to pray . Colman suggests that the passage is borrowed from some lines of Menander still in existence . ]\u2014 Ver . 730 . He pauses after \u201c quidem ,\u201d but he means to say that if he had his choice , he would rather it had not been so . ]\u2014 Ver . 742 . The \u201c tesser\u00e6 \u201d of the ancients were cubes , or what we call \u201c dice ;\u201d while the \u201c tali \u201d were in imitation of the knuckle-bones of animals , and were marked on four sides only . For some account of the mode of playing with the \u201c tali ,\u201d see the last Scene of the Asinaria , and the Curculio of Plautus , l. 257-9 . Madame Dacier suggests that Menander may possibly have borrowed this passage from the Republic of Plato , B. X ., where he says , \u201c We should take counsel from accidents , and , as in a game at dice , act according to what has fallen , in the manner which reason tells us to be the best .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 755 . \u201c Restim ductans saltabis .\u201d Donatus and Madame Dacier think that this is only a figurative expression for a dance in which all joined hands ; according to some , however , a dance is alluded to where the person who led off drew a rope or cord after him , which the rest of the company took hold of as they danced ; which was invented in resemblance of the manner in which the wooden horse was dragged by ropes into the city of Troy . ]\u2014 Ver . 764 . See an observation relative to the translation of the word \u201c Salus ,\u201d in the Notes to Plautus , vol . i. pages 193 , 450 . ]\u2014 Ver . 767 . His duty of providing the viands and drink for the entertainment . So Ergasilus says in the Captivi of Plautus , l. 912 , \u201c Now I will go off to my government, to give laws to the bacon .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 795 . Colman remarks on this passage : \u201c The character of Micio appears extremely amiable through the first four Acts of this Comedy , and his behavior is in many respects worthy of imitation ; but his conduct in conniving at the irregularities of Ctesipho , and even assisting him to support them , is certainly reprehensible . Perhaps the Poet threw this shade over his virtues on purpose to show that mildness and good-humor might be carried to excess .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 824 . Colman observes here : \u201c Madame Dacier makes an observation on this speech , something like that of Donatus on one of Micio \u2019 s above ; and says that Micio , being hard put to it by the real circumstances of the case , thinks to confound Demea by a nonsensical gallimatia . I can not be of the ingenious lady \u2019 s opinion on this matter , for I think a more sensible speech could not be made , nor a better plea offered in favor of the young men , than that of Micio in the present instance .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 851 .

The emptiness of his poor attempts to be familiar are very evident in this line . ]\u2014 Ver . 908 . \u201c Tibicin\u00e6 ,\u201d or music-girls , attended at marriage ceremonials . See the Aulularia of Plautus , where Megadorus hires the music-girls on his intended marriage with the daughter of Euclio . ]\u2014 Ver . 910 . See the Casina of Plautus , Act IV ., Scenes 3 and 4 , for some account of the marriage ceremonial . The torches , music-girls , processions , and hymeneal song , generally accompanied a wedding , but from the present passage we may conclude that they were not considered absolutely necessary . ]\u2014 Ver . 911 . The \u201c maceria ,\u201d or garden-wall of loose stones , is also mentioned in the Truculentus of Plautus , l . 301 . ]\u2014 Ver . 918 . This passage has much puzzled the Commentators ; but it seems most probable that it is said aside , and that in consequence of his profuseness he calls his brother a Babylonian ,and says , \u201c Well , let him , with all my heart , be paying twenty min\u00e6for music-girl .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 940 . \u00c6schinus , probably , in his earnestness , has seized hold of him with his hand , which Micio now pushes away . ]\u2014 Ver . 943 . This is not the truth ; the notion has only been started since he last saw them . ]\u2014 Ver . 946 . \u201c Vis est h\u00e6c quidem .\u201d The same expression occurs in the Captivi of Plautus , l. 755 . The expression seemed to be a common one with the Romans . According to Suetonius , Julius C\u00e6sar used it when attacked by his murderers in the senate-house . On Tullius Cimber seizing hold of his garments , he exclaimed , \u201c Ita quidem vis est !\u201d\u2014 \u201c Why , really , this is violence !\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 947 . Donatus informs us that in Menander \u2019 s Play , the old man did not make any resistance whatever to the match thus patched up for him . Colman has the following observation on this fact : \u201c It is surprising that none of the critics on this passage have taken notice of this observation of Donatus , especially as our loss of Menander makes it rather curious . It is plain that Terence in the plan of his last Act followed Menander ; but though he has adopted the absurdity of marrying Micio to the old lady , yet we learn from Donatus that his judgment rather revolted at this circumstance , and he improved on his original by making Micio express a repugnance to such a match , which it seems he did not in the Play of Menander .\u201d]\u2014 Ver . 961 . He probably means , by aping the kind feeling which is a part of Micio \u2019 s character . ]\u2014 Ver . 969 . A banquet in the early part or middle of the day was considered by the Greeks a debauch . ]\u2014 Ver . 974 . He touches Syrus on the ear , and makes him free .

Her gown is simple , girlish and attractive , and made of summery , filmy stuff . Her hair is done up in the simplest fashion , with a part in the centre , and there is about her every indication of an effort to assume that girlishness of demeanour which has been her greatest asset through life . WILLARD BROCKTON enters ; he is a man six feet or more in height , stocky in build , clean-shaven and immaculately dressed . He is smoking a cigar , and upon entering takes one step forward and looks over toward LAURA in a semi-meditative manner .", "When the curtain rises on this scene it is noticeable that the occupants of the room must have returned rather late at night , after having dined , not wisely , but too well . In the alcove is a man 's dress-coat and vest thrown on the cushions in a most careless manner ; a silk hat badly rumpled is near it . Over the top of sofa is an opera-cloak , and hung on the mirror is a huge hat , of the evening type , such as women would pay handsomely for . A pair of gloves is thrown on top of the pier-glass . The curtains in the bay-window are half drawn , and the light shades are half drawn down the windows , so that when the curtain goes up the place is in a rather dim light . On the table are the remains of a breakfast , which is served in a box-like tray such as is used in hotels . LAURA is discovered sitting at right of table , her hair a bit untidy . She has on a very expensive neglig\u00e9e gown . WILL , in a business suit , is at the other side of the table , and both have evidently just about concluded their breakfast and are reading the newspapers while they sip their coffee . LAURA is intent in the scanning of her \u201c Morning Telegraph , \u201d while WILL is deep in the market reports of the \u201c Journal of Commerce , \u201d and in each instance these things must be made apparent . WILL throws down the paper rather impatiently ."]}, "act_index": 24, "play_index": 24}, {"data": {"958": ["How old is he ?", "Have you heard from him ?", "It 's the newspaper man , eh ?", "Blue ?", "Did she say what train she was coming on ?", "Address it the way you want to .I 'm going to be pretty brutal . In the long run I think that is best , do n't you ?", "I 'm sorry , but I 've got to . I toldMadison\u2014 pardon me , but I must do this \u2014 that if this time ever came I 'd have you write him the truth . Before we go any further I 'd like you to do that now .", "Thank you .", "Why ?", "Well , you liked it , did n't you ?", "If you want to work , Burgess has a nice part for you . I 'll telephone and arrange if you say so .", "And if she should ever go back and come to me , I am going to insist that she let you know all about it . It 'll be hard enough to lose her , caring for her the way you do , but it would hurt a lot more to be double-crossed .", "Surely . LAURA hurriedly exits . WILL goes down centre of the stage . After a short interval LAURA comes in , more like a sixteen-year-old girl than anything else , pulling JOHN after her . He is a tall , finely built type of Western manhood , a frank face , a quick , nervous energy , a mind that works like lightning , a prepossessing smile , and a personality that is wholly captivating . His clothes are a bit dusty from the ride , but are not in the least pretentious , and his leggins are of canvas and spurs of brass , such as are used in the Army . His hat is off , and he is pulled on to the stage , more like a great big boy than a man . His hair is a bit tumbled , and he shows every indication of having had a rather long and hard ride .", "What the hell is the use of fussing with a woman .", "The way you are looking .", "And may I ask what circumstances you refer to ?", "Too bad he could n't get this a little sooner , eh , Laura ?", "So you 've been corresponding all this time .", "Well , you do n't have to go .", "Your old friend Madison .", "I was n't conscious that I was looking at you in any particular way \u2014 why ?", "I thought that I was pretty decent to take a dusty ride half-way across the continent in order to keep you company on your way back to New York , and welcome you to our home ; but maybe I had the wrong idea .", "And you did n't know Madison was coming East until you read about it in that newspaper ?", "So did I , but somehow I think that maybe we do n't quite understand each other .", "You know , dearie , I do a lot for you because you 've always been on the level with me . I 'm sorry I hurt you , but there was too much wine last night and I 'm all upset . Forgive me . LAURA , in order to avoid his caresses , has leaned forward ; her hands are clasped between her knees , and she is looking straight outward with a cold , impassive expression . WILL regards her silently for a moment . Really in the man 's heart there is an affection , and really he wants to try to comfort her ; but he seems to realize that she has slipped away from the old environment and conditions , and that he simply bought her back ; that he has n't any of her affection , even with his money ; that she evinces toward him none of the old camaraderie ; and it hurts him , as those things always hurt a selfish man , inclining him to be brutal and inconsiderate . WILL crosses to centre , and stands reading paper ; bell rings ; a pause and second bell . WILL seizes upon this excuse to go up-stage and over towards the door .", "I 'll leave , Madison , but I 'm not going to let you think that I did n't do the right thing with you . She came to me voluntarily . She said she wanted to come back . I told you that , when I was in Colorado , and you did n't believe me , and I told you that when she did this sort of thing I 'd let you know . I dictated a letter to her to send to you , and I left it sealed and stamped in her hands to mail . She did n't do it . If there 's been a lie , she told it . I did n't . JOHN turns to her . She hangs her head and averts her eyes in a mute acknowledgment of guilt . The revelation hits JOHN so hard that he sinks on the trunk centre , his head fallen to his breast . He is utterly limp and whipped . There is a moment 's silence .", "A real man . By that you mean \u2014", "Think he is going to make a proposition , eh ?", "I did n't think it was possible for me to miss anyone the way I have you . I 've been lonely .", "Down in the mouth , eh ? I 'm sorry .", "Pay you well ?", "She picked me up at Martin 's ; we lunched there .", "Draw those porti\u00e8res . Let those curtains up .Let 's have a little light . Take away these clothes and hide them . Do n't you know that a man does n't want to see the next morning anything to remind him of the night before . Make the place look a little respectable . In the meantime ANNIE scurries around , picking up the coat and vest , opera-cloak , & c ., as rapidly as possible , and throwing them over her arm without any idea of order . It is very apparent that she is rather fearful of the anger of WILL while he is in this mood .", "Gun-fighter , eh ?", "Yes .", "No one 's listening .", "Well , there are a lot of trains . About what time did you expect her in ?", "You 've been on the square with me this summer , have n't you ?", "You know I do n't want to delve into a lot of past history at this time , but I 've got to talk to you for a moment .", "What 's up ?", "Thank you again .", "Of course you are going with him ?", "I do n't quite get you .", "I 'll give you every chance that you deserve when he knows .

I did n't mean that , Laura . I guess I am feeling a little bad to-day . Really , I do n't want to hurt your feelings , my dear . He gets up , goes to her , puts his hands on her shoulders , and his cheek close to the back of her head . She bends forward and shudders a little bit . It is very easy to see that the life she is leading is becoming intolerable to her .", "Well , young man , I size up a fellow in pretty short order , and all things being equal , I think you 'll do .", "I know .", "Yes , I have given up the lease of our apartment on West End Avenue , and I 've got a house on Riverside Drive . Everything will be quiet and decent , and it 'll be more comfortable for you . There 's a stable near by , and your horses and car can be kept over there . You 'll be your own mistress , and besides I 've fixed you up for a new part .", "There 's where you make a mistake . Money-getting does n't always come with brilliancy . I know a lot of fellows in New York who can paint a great picture , write a good play , and , when it comes to oratory , they 've got me lashed to a pole ; but they 're always in debt . They never get anything for what they do . In other words , young man , they are like a sky-rocket without a stick ,\u2014 plenty of brilliancy , but no direction , and they blow up and fizzle all over the ground .", "Waiting for him to come ?", "I guess you 're on the safe side . It was a great old party , though , was n't it ?", "Hello , Madison , when did you get in ? Slowly JOHN seems to recover himself . His right hand starts up toward the lapel of his coat and slowly he pulls his Colt revolver from the holster under his armpit . There is a deadly determination and deliberation in every movement that he makes . WILL jumps to his feet and looks at him . The revolver is uplifted in the air , as a Western man handles a gun , so that when it is snapped down with a jerk the deadly shot can be fired . LAURA is terror-stricken , but before the shot is fired she takes a step forward and extends one hand in a gesture of entreaty .", "Just thought you might meet him , that 's all . Do n't get sore about it .", "Why , yes \u2014 do you ?", "And his job ?", "But I 've got to talk to you . Laura , you 're lying to me .", "Do I know him ?", "I 'm a broker .", "Is that the fellow coming up here ?", "I do n't know him .", "After ten .", "Well , what have you got her for ,\u2014 to eat or to wait on you ?

Do n't you know that I like that young fellow , and I wanted to protect him , and did everything I could to help him ? And do you know what you 've done to me ? You 've made me out a liar \u2014 you 've made me lie to a man \u2014 a man \u2014 you understand . What are you going to do now ? Tell me \u2014 what are you going to do now ?

If that 's the way you want it to be , I 'll stand by just exactly what I said, but I 'm fond of you , a damn sight fonder than I thought I was , now that I find you slipping away ; but if this young fellow is on the squareand he has youth and ability , and you 've been on the square with him , why , all right . Your life has n't had much in it to help you get a diploma from any celestial college , and if you can start out now and be a good girl , have a good husband , and maybe some day good children, why , I 'm not going to stand in the way . Only I do n't want you to make any of those mistakes that you made before .", "If you do n't mind , I 'll stay here .", "In somewhat of a hurry , I should say .", "I think I understand your position , young man , and I perfectly agree with you , that is \u2014 if your plans come out successfully .", "\u201c I will be in New York before noon .

There is an obvious embarrassment on the part of each of them . She rises , goes to him and extends her hand .", "And you mean to tell me that you kept your promise and told him the truth ?", "Well , I hope I 'll like him .", "Not at all unless you want to . I understand \u2014 in fact , I always have .", "Then how do you know you can ?", "Huh .", "You 're crazy .", "By George , this is funny .", "He is a good-looking chap .", "Why ?", "Do I know her ?", "It will be just the same as it was before , you know .", "No , I do n't make any such gloomy prophecy . If you make Laura a good husband , and she makes you a good wife , and together you win out , I 'll be mighty glad . As far as I am concerned I shall absolutely forget every thought of Laura 's friendship for me .", "What 's up that way ?", "I hope you 'll make your money , because I tell you frankly that 's the only way you can hold this girl . She 's full of heroics now , self-sacrifice , and all the things that go to make up the third act of a play , but the minute she comes to darn her stockings , wash out her own handkerchiefs and dry them on the window , and send out for a pail of coffee and a sandwich for lunch , take it from me it will go Blah !You 're in Colorado writing her letters once a day with no checks in them . That may be all right for some girl who has n't tasted the joy of easy living , full of the good things of life , but one who for ten years has been doing very well in the way these women do is not going to let up for any great length of time . So take my advice if you want to hold her . Get that money quick , and do n't be so damned particular how you get it either . JOHN 'S patience is evidently severely tried .

That 's why I 've liked you a lot better than the other women .", "Are you going to make me take it awayfrom you ? I 'venever laid my hands on you yet .", "That letter I dictated to you the day that you came back to me , and left it for you to mail \u2014 did you mail it ?", "Not planned \u2014 just hoped . I think you 'd better go to some nice hotel now . Later we can arrange .", "In love , eh ?", "Depends on the train you take .", "It has got to go just that way \u2014 \u201c I do not love you . \u201d Sign it \u201c Laura . \u201dFold it , put it in an envelope \u2014 seal it \u2014 address it .

Are you going to play the same game again ?", "No , I 'll wait . This time I 'm going to tell him myself , and I do n't care how tough it is .", "All right . For a moment LAURA sits silent , and then angrily rises , crosses up to dresser , gets alcohol lamp , crosses to table with lamp , lights same , and starts back to dresser .

The first door closes . In a moment the second door is slammed . JOHN and LAURA look at each other for a moment . He gives her no chance to speak . The hurt in his heart and his accusation are shown by his broken manner . A great grief has come into his life and he does n't quite understand it . He seems to be feeling around for something to say , some way to get out . His head turns toward the door .

This is a game , Laura , not a sentiment . Do you suppose this Madison\u2014 now do n't get sore \u2014 has n't turned these tricks himself before he met you , and I 'll gamble he 's done it since ! A man 's natural trade is a heartbreaking business . Do n't tell me about women breaking men 's hearts . The only thing they can ever break is their bank roll . And besides , this is not Will 's business ; he has no right to interfere . You 've been with him \u2014 yes , and he 's been nice to you ; but I do n't think that he 's given you any the best of it . Now if you want to leave and go your own way and marry any Tom , Dick , or Harry that you want , it 's nobody 's affair but yours .", "Well , I should say you have \u2014 and more than I would . Anyway a good cry never hurts any woman . I have one myself , sometimes \u2014 under cover .", "What !Dearie , get that nonsense out of your head and be sensible . I 'd just like to see any two men who could make me think about \u2014 well \u2014 what you seem to have in your mind .", "Oh ! And you 'll promise me , Laura ?", "Not any more than I can help and be nice . He gets on my nerves . Of course , I 've heard about your quitting Brockton .", "Yes , I 'm afraid I 'll have to . I think I need a sort of a boost to my popularity .", "If I think he 's the fellow when I see him , watch me and I 'll tip you the wink .She goes up stage to centre ; LAURA remains in her position . The doors are heard to open , and in a moment JOHN enters . He is dressed very neatly in a business suit , and his face is tanned and weather-beaten . After he enters , he stands still for a moment . The emotion that both he and LAURA go through is such that each is trying to control it , LAURA from the agony of her position , and JOHN from the mere hurt of his affection . He sees ELFIE and forces a smile .", "If it 's a touch , you 'll have to wait until next week .", "Now you 're a sensible dear . I 'll bet he 's half frozen down there .I 'll send him up . Look at you , Laura , you 're a sight .It 'll never do to have him see you looking like this ; come over here and let me fix your eyes . Now , Laura , I want you to promise me you wo n't do any more crying .Come over here and let me powder your nose . Now when he comes up you tell him he has got to blow us all off to a dinner to-night at Martin 's , seven-thirty . Let me look at you . Now you 're all right .Make it strong now , seven-thirty , do n't forget . I 'll be there .So long .After ELFIE 'S exit LAURA crosses slowly to wardrobe , pulls off picture of JOHN ; crosses to dresser , takes picture of JOHN from there ; carries both pictures over to bed ; kneels on bed , pulls down picture at head of bed ; places all three pictures under pillow . WILL is heard coming upstairs , and knocks .", "Yes .", "Do n't be foolish , dearie . You know there is somebody waiting for you \u2014 somebody who 'll be good to you and get you out of this mess .", "Well ?", "Because I want to help you .", "It 's a bully day out .I 've been shopping all morning long ; just blew myself until I 'm broke , that 's all . My goodness , do n't you ever get dressed ? Listen .Talk about cinches . I copped out a gown , all ready made , and fits me like the paper on the wall , for $ 37. 80 . Looks like it might have cost $ 200 . Anyway I had them charge $ 200 on the bill , and I kept the change . There are two or three more down town there , and I want you to go down and look them over . Models , you know , being sold out . I do n't blame you for not getting up earlier .That was some party last night . I know you did n't drink a great deal , but gee ! what an awful tide Will had on . How do you feel ?What 's the matter , are you sick ? You look all in . What you want to do is this \u2014 put on your duds and go out for an hour . It 's a perfectly grand day out . My Gaud ! how the sun does shine ! Clear and cold .Well , much obliged for the conversation . Do n't I get a \u201c Good-morning , \u201d or a \u201c How-dy-do , \u201d or a something of that sort ?", "How do you know ?", "Me ?", "Yes , you burned it .", "Five minutes past eleven .", "Now .", "So that 's the kind of woman you are , eh ? A moment ago you were going to kick me out of the place because I was n't decent enough to associate with you . You know how I live . You know how I get my money \u2014 the same way you got most of yours . And now that you 've got this spasm of goodness I 'm not fit to be in your room ; but you 'll take my money to pay your debts . You 'll let me go out and do this sort of thing for your benefit , while you try to play the grand lady . I 've got your number now , Laura . Where in hell is your virtue anyway ? You can go to the devil \u2014 rich , poor , or any other way . I 'm off ! ELFIE rushes toward door ; for a moment LAURA stands speechless , then bursts into hysterics .", "Yes , there is . What happened between you and Brockton ?He 's not broke , because I saw him the other day .", "Oh , yes , you can . You can say anything to me \u2014 everybody else does . We 've been pals . I know you got along a little faster in the business than I did . The chorus was my limit , and you went into the legitimate thing . But we got our living just the same way . I did n't suppose there was any secret between you and me about that .", "Oh , never mind . It 's such a grand day outside , and I 've come around in my car to take you out .You know I 've got a new one , and it can go some .", "You know , Laura , I 'm not much on giving advice , but you make me sick . I thought you 'd grown wise . A young girl just butting into this business might possibly make a fool of herself , but you ought to be on to the game and make the best of it .", "Lend you thirty-five dollars ?", "No ? Why do n't I understand ?", "No wonder you look tired . Say , listen , dearie . What else is the matter with you anyway ?", "All right , if that 's the way you want it to be , I 'm sorry .", "Yes . Shall I tell him to come up ?", "I do n't know , do n't I ? I do n't know , I suppose , that when I came to this town from up state ,\u2014 a little burg named Oswego ,\u2014 and joined a chorus , that I did n't fall in love with just such a man . I suppose I do n't know that then I was the best-looking girl in New York , and everybody talked about me ? I suppose I do n't know that there were men , all ages and with all kinds of money , ready to give me anything for the mere privilege of taking me out to supper ? And I did n't do it , did I ? For three years I stuck by this good man who was to lead me in a good way toward a good life . And all the time I was getting older , never quite so pretty one day as I had been the day before . I never knew then what it was to be tinkered with by hair-dressers and manicures or a hundred and one of those other people who make you look good . I did n't have to have them then .Well , you know , Laura , what happened .", "And you love him ?", "Well , I should say not . I 'm going to give up my musical career . Charlie Burgess is putting on a new play , and he says he has a part in it for me if I want to go back . It is n't much , but very important ,\u2014 sort of a pantomime part . A lot of people talk about me , and just at the right time I walk across the stage and make an awful hit . I told Jerry that if I wenton he 'd have to come across with one of those Irish crochet lace gowns . He fell for it . Do you know , dearie , I think he 'd sell out his business just to have me back on the stage for a couple of weeks , just to give box-parties every night for my en-trance and ex-its .", "I think he is getting a relapse of that front-row habit . There 's no use in talking , Laura , it 's a great thing for a girl 's credit when a man like Jerry can take two or three friends to the theatre , and when you make your entrance delicately point to you with his forefinger and say , \u201c The third one from the front on the left belongs to muh . \u201d The old fool 's hanging around some of these musical comedies lately , and I 'm getting a little nervous every time rent day comes .", "I should think not . I have n't seen you in Rector 's or Martin 's since you come back from Denver . Got a glimpse of you one day trailing up Broadway , but could n't get to you \u2014 you dived into some office or other .Gee ! Whatever made you come into a dump like this ? It 's the limit .", "I think Jerry is getting cold feet . He 's seeing a little too much of menowadays .", "Not !", "Then you 're a chump . Has n't he sent you anything ?", "How ?", "Looks more like a prison .Makes me think of the old days of Child 's sinkers and a hall bedroom .", "Same thing . Do I know him ?", "Laura , you old dear, I 've just found out where you 've been hiding , and came around to see you .", "Well , you did , and you did n't kick .", "Oh , forget that .", "A man ?", "Well , that 's too bad about you . I used to have that truthful habit myself , and the best I ever got was the worst of it . All this talk about love and loyalty and constancy is fine and dandy in a book , but when a girl has to look out for herself , take it from me , whenever you 've got that trump card up your sleeve just play it and rake in the pot .You know , dearie , you 're just about the only one in the world I love .", "Well , Jerry 's got to stake me to one of these .\u201c Tannhauser , William Tell , Chopin . \u201dListen , dear . Ai n't you got anything else except all this high-brow stuff ?", "Well , what does he think you 're going to live on ?\u2014 asphalt croquettes with conversation sauce ?", "Since I broke away from the folks up state and they 've heard things , there ai n't any more letters coming to me with an Oswego postmark . Ma 's gone , and the rest do n't care . You 're all I 've got in the world , Laura , and what I 'm asking you to do is because I want to see you happy . I was afraid this thing was coming off , and the thing to do now is to grab your happiness , no matter how you get it nor where it comes from . There ai n't a whole lot of joy in this world for you and me and the others we know , and what little you get you 've got to take when you 're young , because , when those gray hairs begin to come , and the make-up is n't going to hide the wrinkles , unless you 're well fixed , it 's going to be hell . You know what a fellow does n't know does n't hurt him , and he 'll love you just the same and you 'll love him . As for Brockton , let him get another girl ; there 're plenty \u2018 round . Why , if this chance came to me I 'd tie a can to Jerry so quick that you could hear it rattle all the way down Broadway .Dearie , promise me that you wo n't be a damn fool .", "Huh !", "Do you know , Laura , I think I 'll go back on the stage ."]}, "act_index": 24, "play_index": 24}, {"data": {"969": ["But when dun night \u2014\u2014", "Still new horrors", "Increase each hour , and gather round our heads .", "Thou must withdraw thee hence ; regain once more", "Yet , yet a moment ; hear , Philotas , hear me .", "To gild the clouds , that hover o'er your head ,", "Surnam 'd the Tyrant ?

To save that idol , reputation . If the familiarities of our loves had produced that consequence of which you were apprehensive , where could you have fixed a father 's name with credit but on a husband ? I knew Fainall to be a man lavish of his morals , an interested and professing friend , a false and a designing lover , yet one whose wit and outward fair behaviour have gained a reputation with the town , enough to make that woman stand excused who has suffered herself to be won by his addresses . A better man ought not to have been sacrificed to the occasion ; a worse had not answered to the purpose .

For my part I will contribute all that in me lies to a reunion .

After our Epilogue this crowd dismisses , I 'm thinking how this play 'll be pulled to pieces . But pray consider , e'er you doom its fall , How hard a thing \u2018 twould be to please you all . There are some critics so with spleen diseased , They scarcely come inclining to be pleased : And sure he must have more than mortal skill Who pleases anyone against his will . Then , all bad poets we are sure are foes , And how their number 's swelled the town well knows In shoals , I 've marked \u2018 em judging in the pit ; Though they 're on no pretence for judgment fit , But that they have been damned for want of wit . Since when , they , by their own offences taught , Set up for spies on plays , and finding fault . Others there are whose malice we 'd prevent : Such , who watch plays , with scurrilous intent To mark out who by characters are meant : And though no perfect likeness they can trace , Yet each pretends to know the copied face . These , with false glosses , feed their own ill-nature , And turn to libel what was meant a satire . May such malicious fops this fortune find , To think themselves alone the fools designed : If any are so arrogantly vain , To think they singly can support a scene , And furnish fool enough to entertain . For well the learned and the judicious know , That satire scorns to stoop so meanly low , As any one abstracted fop to show . For , as when painters form a matchless face , They from each fair one catch some diff'rent grace , And shining features in one portrait blend , To which no single beauty must pretend : So poets oft do in one piece expose Whole BELLES ASSEMBLEES of coquettes and beaux .", "Witwoud ?", "I was then in such a humour , that I should have been better pleased if she had been less discreet .", "You are merry , madam , but I would persuade you for a moment to be serious .", "I thank you , I know as much as my curiosity requires . Fainall , are you for the Mall ?", "Then we 're agreed . Shall I kiss your hand upon the contract ? And here comes one to be a witness to the sealing of the deed .", "Wilfull 's arrival .", "So one will be rotten before he be ripe , and the other will be rotten without ever being ripe at all .", "Like Daphne she , as lovely and as coy .

I must have leave for two criminals to appear .", "Pray , are the follies of this knight-errant and those of the squire , his brother , anything related ?", "That was by Foible 's direction and my instruction , that she might seem to carry it more privately .", "Let me be pitied first , and afterwards forgotten .

Wielpoints out that , according to the Dolfin Cronaca , which Berlan did not consult , Jacopo was in a \u201c mutilated \u201d condition when the trial was over , and he was permitted to take a last farewell of his wife and children in Torricella .

He had been despatched by the X. to Legnano , to investigate the conduct of Andrea Donate , the Doge 's brother-in-law , who was suspected of having embezzled the public moneys . His report was unfavourable to Donato , and , shortly after , he too fell sick and died . It is most improbable that the Doge was directly or indirectly responsible for the death of either brother ; but there was an hereditary feud , and the libellous epitaph was a move in the game . ]{ 124 }4 \u2014\u2014 checked by nought The vessel that creaks \u2014\u2014.\u2014{ 125 } \u2014\u2014 much pity .\u2014{ 126 } In this brief colloquy , and must redeem it .\u2014\u201c And I have loved thee , Ocean ! and my joy Of youthful sports was on thy breast to be Borne , like thy bubbles , onward : from a boy I wantoned with thy breakers . \u201d Childe Harold , Canto IV . stanza clxxxiv . lines 1-4 , Poetical Works , 1899 , ii . 461 , note 2 . ]{ 127 }I see your colour comes .\u2014{ 130 }\u2014 \u2018 A daughter of the house that now among Its ancestors in monumental brass Numbers eight Doges . \u2019 On the occasion of her marriage the Bucentaur came out in its splendour ; and a bridge of boats was thrown across the Canal Grande for the bridegroom and his retinue of three hundred horse . \u201d \u2014 Foscari , by Samuel Rogers , Poems , 1852 , ii . 93 , note .

INTRODUCTION TO CAIN . Cain was begun at Ravenna , July 16 , and finished September 9 , 1821Six months before , when he was at work on the first act of Sardanapalus , Byron had \u201c pondered \u201d Cain , but it was not till Sardanapalus and a second historical play , The Two Foscari , had been written , copied out , and sent to England , that he indulged his genius with a third drama \u2014 on \u201c a metaphysical subject , something in the style of Manfred \u201dGoethe 's comment on reading and reviewing Cain was that he should be surprised if Byron did not pursue the treatment of such \u201c biblical subjects , \u201d as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah; and , many years after , he told Crabb Robinsonthat Byron should have lived \u201c to execute his vocation ... to dramatize the Old Testament . \u201d He was better equipped for such a task than might have been imagined . A Scottish schoolboy , \u201c from a child he had known the Scriptures , \u201d and , as his Hebrew Melodies testify , he was not unwilling to turn to the Bible as a source of poetic inspiration . Moreover , he was born with the religious temperament . Questions \u201c of Providence , foreknowledge , will and fate , \u201d exercised his curiosity because they appealed to his imagination and moved his spirit . He was eager to plunge into controversy with friends and advisers who challenged or rebuked him , Hodgson , for instance , or Dallas ; and he responded with remarkable amenity to the strictures and exhortations of such orthodox professors as Mr. Sheppard and Dr. Kennedy . He was , no doubt , from first to last a heretic , impatient , not to say contemptuous , of authority , but he was by no means indifferent to religion altogether . To \u201c argue about it and about \u201d was a necessity , if not an agreeable relief , to his intellectual energies . It would appear from the Ravenna diary, that the conception of Lucifer was working in his brain before the \u201c tragedy of Cain \u201d was actually begun . He had been recording a \u201c thought \u201d which had come to him , that \u201c at the very height of human desire and pleasure , a certain sense of doubt and sorrow \u201d \u2014 an amari aliquid which links the future to the past , and so blots out the present \u2014 \u201c mingles with our bliss , \u201d making it of none effect , and , by way of moral or corollary to his soliloquy , he adds three lines of verse headed , \u201c Thought for a speech of Lucifer in the Tragedy of Cain \u201d \u2014 \u201c Were Death an Evil , would I let thee live ? Fool ! live as I live \u2014 as thy father lives , And thy son 's sons shall live for evermore . \u201d In these three lines , which were not inserted in the play , and in the preceding \u201c thought , \u201d we have the key-note to Cain . \u201c Man walketh in a vain shadow \u201d \u2014 a shadow which he can never overtake , the shadow of an eternally postponed fruition . With a being capable of infinite satisfaction , he is doomed to realize failure in attainment . In all that is best and most enjoyable , \u201c the rapturous moment and the placid hour , \u201d there is a foretaste of \u201c Death the Unknown \u201d ! The tragedy of Manfred lies in remorse for the inevitable past ; the tragedy of Cain , in revolt against the limitations of the inexorable present . The investigation of the \u201c sources \u201d of Cain does not lead to any very definite conclusionHe was pleased to call his play \u201c a Mystery , \u201d and , in his Preface, Byron alludes to the Old Mysteries as \u201c those very profane productions , whether in English , French , Italian , or Spanish . \u201d The first reprint of the Chester Plays was published by the Roxburghe Club in 1818 , but Byron 's knowledge of Mystery Plays was probably derived from Dodsley 's Plays, or from John Stevens 's Continuation of Dugdale 's Monasticon, or possibly , as Herr Schaffner suggests , from Warton 's History of English Poetry , ed . 1871 , ii . 222-230 . He may , too , have witnessed some belated Rappresentazione of the Creation and Fall at Ravenna , or in one of the remoter towns or villages of Italy . There is a superficial resemblance between the treatment of the actual encounter of Cain and Abel , and the conventional rendering of the same incident in the Ludus Coventri\u00e6 , and in the Mist\u00e8re du Viel Testament ; but it is unlikely that he had closely studied any one Mystery Play at first hand . On the other hand , his recollections of Gessner 's Death of Abel which \u201c he had never read since he was eight years old , \u201d were clearer than he imagined . Not only in such minor matters as the destruction of Cain 's altar by a whirlwind , and the substitution of the Angel of the Lord for the Deus of the Mysteries , but in the Teutonic domesticities of Cain and Adah , and the evangelical piety of Adam and Abel , there is a reflection , if not an imitation , of the German idyllOf his indebtedness to Milton he makes no formal acknowledgment , but he was not ashamed to shelter himself behind Milton 's shield when he was attacked on the score of blasphemy and profanity . \u201c If Cain be blasphemous , Paradise Lost is blasphemous \u201d, was , he would fain believe , a conclusive answer to his accusers . But apart from verbal parallels or coincidences , there is a genuine affinity between Byron 's Lucifer and Milton 's Satan . Lucifer , like Satan , is \u201c not less than Archangel ruined , \u201d a repulsed but \u201c unvanquished Titan , \u201d marred by a demonic sorrow , a confessor though a rival of Omnipotence . He is a majestic and , as a rule , a serious and solemn spirit , who compels the admiration and possibly the sympathy of the reader . There is , however , another strain in his ghostly attributes , which betrays a more recent consanguinity : now and again he gives token that he is of the lineage of Mephistopheles . He is sometimes , though rarely , a mocking as well as a rebellious spirit , and occasionally indulges in a grim persiflage beneath the dignity if not the capacity of Satan . It is needless to add that Lucifer has a most lifelike personality of his own . The conception of the spirit of evil justifying an eternal antagonism to the Creator from the standpoint of a superior morality , may , perhaps , be traced to a Manichean source , but it has been touched with a new emotion . Milton 's devil is an abstraction of infernal pride \u2014 \u201c Sole Positive of Night ! Antipathist of Light ! Fate 's only essence ! primal scorpion rod \u2014 The one permitted opposite of God ! \u201d Goethe 's devil is an abstraction of scorn . He \u201c maketh a mock \u201d alike of good and evil ! But Byron 's devil is a spirit , yet a mortal too \u2014 the traducer , because he has suffered for his sins ; the deceiver , because he is self-deceived ; the hoper against hope that there is a ransom for the soul in perfect self-will and not in perfect self-sacrifice . Byron did not uphold Lucifer , but he \u201c had passed that way , \u201d and could imagine a spiritual warfare not only against the Deus of the Mysteries or of the Book of Genesis , but against what he believed and acknowledged to be the Author and Principle of good . Autres temps , autres m\u0153urs ! It is all but impossible for the modern reader to appreciate the audacity of Cain , or to realize the alarm and indignation which it aroused by its appearance . Byron knew that he was raising a tempest , and pleads , in his Preface , \u201c that with regard to the language of Lucifer , it was difficult for me to make him talk like a clergyman , \u201d and again and again he assures his correspondentsthat it is Lucifer and not Byron who puts such awkward questions with regard to the \u201c politics of paradise \u201d and the origin of evil . Nobody seems to have believed him . It was taken for granted that Lucifer was the mouthpiece of Byron , that the author of Don Juan was not \u201c on the side of the angels . \u201d Little need be said of the \u201c literature , \u201d the pamphlets and poems which were evoked by the publication of Cain : A Mystery . One of the most prominent assailants, Archdeacon of Cleveland , 1832 , author inter alia of Original Sin , Free Will , etc ., 1818 ) issued A Remonstrance to Mr. John Murray , respecting a Recent Publication , 1822 , signed \u201c Oxoniensis . \u201d The sting of the Remonstrance lay in the exposure of the fact that Byron was indebted to Bayle 's Dictionary for his rabbinical legends , and that he had derived from the same source his Manichean doctrines of the Two Principles , etc ., and other \u201c often-refuted sophisms \u201d with regard to the origin of evil . Byron does not borrow more than a poet and a gentleman is at liberty to acquire by way of raw material , but it cannot be denied that he had read and inwardly digested more than one of Bayle 's \u201c most objectionable articles \u201dThe Remonstrance was answered in A Letter to Sir Walter Scott , etc ., by \u201c Harroviensis . \u201d Byron welcomed such a \u201c Defender of the Faith , \u201d and was anxious that Murray should print the letter together with the poem . But Murray belittled the \u201c defender , \u201d and was upbraided in turn for his slowness of heartFresh combatants rushed into the fray : \u201c Philo-Milton , \u201d with a Vindication of the \u201c Paradise Lost \u201d from the charge of exculpating \u201c Cain : A Mystery , \u201d London , 1822 ; \u201c Britannicus , \u201d with a pamphlet entitled , Revolutionary Causes , etc ., and A Postscript containing Strictures on \u201c Cain , \u201d etc ., London , 1822 , etc . ; but their works , which hardly deserve to be catalogued , have perished with them . Finally , in 1830 , a barrister named Harding Grant , author of Chancery Practice , compiled a workof more than four hundred pages , in which he treats \u201c the proceedings and speeches of Lucifer with the same earnestness as if they were existing and earthly personages . \u201d But it was \u201c a week too late . \u201d The \u201c Coryph\u00e6us of the Satanic School \u201d had passed away , and the tumult had \u201c dwindled to a calm . \u201d Cain \u201c appeared in conjunction with \u201d Sardanapalus and The Two Foscari , December 19 , 1821 . Last but not least of the three plays , it had been announced \u201c by a separate advertisement, for the purpose of exciting the greater curiosity \u201d, 1822 , p. 383 ) , and it was no sooner published than it was pirated . In the following January , \u201c Cain : A Mystery , by the author of Don Juan , \u201d was issued by W. Benbow , at Castle Street , Leicester SquareMurray had paid Byron \u00a3 2710 for the three tragedies , and in order to protect the copyright , he applied , through counsel, for an injunction in Chancery to stop the sale of piratical editions of Cain . In delivering judgment, the Chancellor , Lord Eldon, replying to Shadwell , drew a comparison between Cain and Paradise Lost , \u201c which he had read from beginning to end during the course of the last Long Vacation \u2014 solicit\u00e6 jucunda oblivia vit\u00e6 . \u201d No one , he argued , could deny that the object and effects of Paradise Lost were \u201c not to bring into disrepute , \u201d but \u201c to promote reverence for our religion , \u201d and , per contra , no one could affirm that it was impossible to arrive at an opposite conclusion with regard to \u201c the Preface , the poem , the general tone and manner of Cain . \u201d It was a question for a jury . A jury might decide that Cain was blasphemous , and void of copyright ; and as there was a reasonable doubt in his mind as to the character of the book , and a doubt as to the conclusion at which a jury would arrive , he was compelled to refuse the injunction . According to Dr . Smiles, the decision of a jury was taken , and an injunction eventually granted . If so , it was ineffectual , for Benbow issued another edition of Cain in 1824See , too , the case of Murray v. Benbow and Another , as reported in the Examiner , February 17 , 1822 ; and cases of Wolcot v. Walker , Southey v. Sherwood , Murray v. Benbow , and Lawrence v. Smith\u201c Cain , \u201d said Moore, \u201c has made a sensation . \u201d Friends and champions , the press , the public \u201c turned up their thumbs . \u201d Gifford shook his head ; Hobhouse \u201c launched out into a most violent invective \u201d; Jeffrey , in the Edinburgh , was regretful and hortatory ; Heber , in the Quarterly , was fault-finding and contemptuous . The \u201c parsons preached at it from Kentish Town to Pisa \u201dEven \u201c the very highest authority in the land , \u201d his Majesty King George IV ., \u201c expressed his disapprobation of the blasphemy and licentiousness of Lord Byron 's writings \u201dByron himself was forced to admit that \u201c my Mont Saint Jean seems Cain \u201dThe many were unanimous in their verdict , but the higher court of the few reversed the judgment . Goethe said that \u201c Its beauty is such as we shall not see a second time in the world \u201d; Scott , in speaking of \u201c the very grand and tremendous drama of Cain , \u201d said that the author had \u201c matched Milton on his own ground \u201d; \u201c Cain , \u201d wrote Shelley to Gisborne, \u201c is apocalyptic ; it is a revelation never before communicated to man . \u201d Uncritical praise , as well as uncritical censure , belongs to the past ; but the play remains , a singular exercise of \u201c poetic energy , \u201d a confession , ex animo , of \u201c the burthen of the mystery , ... the heavy and the weary weight Of all this unintelligible world . \u201d For reviews of Cain : A Mystery , vide ante , \u201c Introduction to Sardanapalus , \u201d p. 5 ; see , too , Eclectic Review , May , 1822 , N.

TO SIR WALTER SCOTT , BART ., THIS MYSTERY OF CAIN IS INSCRIBED , BY HIS OBLIGED FRIEND AND FAITHFUL SERVANT , THE AUTHOR .PREFACE The following scenes are entitled \u201c A Mystery , \u201d in conformity with the ancient title annexed to dramas upon similar subjects , which were styled \u201c Mysteries , or Moralities . \u201dThe author has by no means taken the same liberties with his subject which were common formerly , as may be seen by any reader curious enough to refer to those very profane productions , whether in English , French , Italian , or Spanish . The author has endeavoured to preserve the language adapted to his characters ; and where it istaken from actual Scripture , he has made as little alteration , even of words , as the rhythm would permit . The reader will recollect that the book of Genesis does not state that Eve was tempted by a demon , but by \u201c the Serpent; \u201d and that only because he was \u201c the most subtil of all the beasts of the field . \u201d Whatever interpretation the Rabbins and the Fathers may have put upon this , I take the words as I find them , and reply , with Bishop Watsonupon similar occasions , when the Fathers were quoted to him as Moderator in the schools of Cambridge , \u201c Behold the Book ! \u201d \u2014 holding up the Scripture . It is to be recollected , that my present subject has nothing to do with the New Testament , to which no reference can be here made without anachronism .With the poems upon similar topics I have not been recently familiar . Since I was twenty I have never read Milton ; but I had read him so frequently before , that this may make little difference . Gesner 's \u201c Death of Abel \u201d I have never read since I was eight years of age , at Aberdeen . The general impression of my recollection is delight ; but of the contents I remember only that Cain 's wife was called Mahala , and Abel 's Thirza ; in the following pages I have called them \u201c Adah \u201d and \u201c Zillah , \u201d the earliest female names which occur in Genesis . They were those of Lamech 's wives : those of Cain and Abel are not called by their names . Whether , then , a coincidence of subject may have caused the same in expression , I know nothing , and care as little .am prepared to be accused of Manicheism ,or some other hard name ending in ism , which makes a formidable figure and awful sound in the eyes and ears of those who would be as much puzzled to explain the terms so bandied about , as the liberal and pious indulgers in such epithets . Against such I can defend myself , or , if necessary , I can attack in turn . \u201c Claw for claw , as Conan said to Satan and the deevil take the shortest nails \u201d] The reader will please to bear in mind, that there is no allusion to a future state in any of the books of Moses , nor indeed in the Old Testament . For a reason for this extraordinary omission he may consult Warburton 's \u201c Divine Legation ; \u201dwhether satisfactory or not , no better has yet been assigned . I have therefore supposed it new to Cain , without , I hope , any perversion of Holy Writ . With regard to the language of Lucifer , it was difficult for me to make him talk like a clergyman upon the same subjects ; but I have done what I could to restrain him within the bounds of spiritual politeness . If he disclaims having tempted Eve in the shape of the Serpent , it is only because the book of Genesis has not the most distant allusion to anything of the kind , but merely to the Serpent in his serpentine capacity .", "To have the courtesy to abdicate .", "True \u2014", "My sire and uncle \u2014 I consent .

The appearance of the land strangled by the ocean will serve by way of scenery and decorations . The affectionate tenderness of Adah for those from whom she is parted , and for ever , and her fears contrasting with the loftier spirit of Aholibamah triumphing in the hopes of a new and greater destiny will make the dialogue . They , in the meantime , continue their a\u00ebrial voyage , everywhere denied admittance in those floating islands over the sea of space , and driven back by guardian-spirits of the different planets , till they are at length forced to alight on the only peak of the earth uncovered by water . Here a parting takes place between the lovers .... The fallen angels are suddenly called , and condemned , their destination and punishment unknown . The sisters cling to the rock , the waters mounting higher and higher . Now enter Ark . The scene draws up , and discovers Japhet endeavouring to persuade the Patriarch , with very strong arguments of love and pity , to receive the sisters , or at least Adah , on board . Adah joins in his entreaties , and endeavours to cling to the sides of the vessel . The proud and haughty Aholibamah scorns to pray either to God or man , and anticipates the grave by plunging into the waters . Noah is still inexorable .is momentarily in danger of perishing before the eyes of the Arkites . Japhet is in despair . The last wave sweeps her from the rock , and her lifeless corpse floats past in all its beauty , whilst a sea-bird screams over it , and seems to be the spirit of her angel lord . I once thought of conveying the lovers to the moon or one of the planets ; but it is not easy for the imagination to make any unknown world more beautiful than this ; besides , I did not think they would approve of the moon as a residence . I remember what Fontenelle said of its having no atmosphere , and the dark spots having caverns where the inhabitants reside . There was another objection : all the human interest would have been destroyed , which I have even endeavoured to give my angels . \u201d ] WERNER ; OR , THE INHERITANCE : A TRAGEDY .Werner was brought out at Drury Lane Theatre , and played , for the first time , December 15 , 1830 . Macready appeared as \u201c Werner , \u201d J. W. Wallack as \u201c Ulric , \u201d Mrs. Faucit as \u201c Josephine , \u201d and Miss Mordaunt as \u201c Ida . \u201d According to the Times , December 16 , 1830 , \u201c Mr. Macready appeared to very great advantage . We have never seen him exert himself more \u2014 we have never known him to exert himself with more powerful effect . Three of his scenes were masterpieces . \u201d Genest says that Werner was acted seventeen times in 1830-31 . There was a revival in 1833 . Macready saysthat he acted \u201c \u2018 Werner \u2019 with unusual force , truth , and collectedness ... finished off each burst of passion , and , in consequence , entered on the following emotion with clearness and earnestness \u201dWerner was played in 1834 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 9 ; in 1841 ; in 1843-4; in 1845; in 1846 , 1847 ; in America in 1848 ; in the provinces in 1849 ; in 1850 ; and , for the last time , at the Theatre Royal , Haymarket , January 14 , 1851 . At the farewell performance Macready appeared as \u201c Werner , \u201d Mr. Davenport as \u201c Ulric , \u201d Mrs. Warner as \u201c Josephine , \u201d Mrs. Ryder as \u201c Ida . \u201d In the same yeara portrait of Macready as \u201c Werner , \u201d by Daniel Maclise , R. A ., was on view at the Exhibition at the Royal Academy . The motto was taken from Werner , act i. sc . 1 , lines 114 , sq .Werner was brought out at Sadler 's Wells Theatre , November 21 , 1860 , and repeated November 22 , 23 , 24 , 28 , 29 ; December , 3 , 4 , 11 , 13 , 14 , 1860 . Phelps appeared as \u201c Werner , \u201d Mr. Edmund Phelps as \u201c Ulric , \u201d Miss Atkinson as \u201c Josephine . \u201d \u201c Perhaps the old actor never performed the part so finely as he did on that night . The identity between the real and ideal relations of the characters was as vivid to him as to the audience , and gave a deeper intensity , on both sides , to the scenes between father and son . \u201dOn the afternoon of June 1 , 1887 , Wernerwas performed at the Lyceum Theatre for the benefit of Westland Marston .Henry Irving appeared as \u201c Werner , \u201d Miss Ellen Terry as \u201c Josephine , \u201d Mr. Alexander as \u201c Ulric . \u201d] INTRODUCTION TO WERNER . Werner ; or , The Inheritance , was begun at Pisa , December 18 , 1821 , and finished January 20 , 1822 . At the end of the month , January 29 , Byron despatched the MS ., not to Murray , but to Moore , then in retreat at Paris , intending , no doubt , that it should be placed in the hands of another publisher ; but a letter from Murray \u201c melted him , \u201d and on March 6 , 1822, he desired Moore to forward the packet to Albemarle Street . The play was set up in type , and revised proofs were returned to Murray at the end of June ; but , for various reasons , publication was withheld , and , on October 31 , Byron informed John Hunt that he had empowered his friend Douglas Kinnaird to obtain Werner , with other MSS ., from Murray . None the less , milder counsels again prevailed , and on Saturday , November 23 , 1822 , Werner was published , not in the same volume with Heaven and Earth , as Byron intended and expected , nor by John Hunt , as he had threatened , but by itself , and , as heretofore , by John Murray . Werner was \u201c the last of all the flock \u201d to issue from Murray 's fold . In his Preface to WernerByron disclaims all pretensions to originality . \u201c The following drama , \u201d he writes , \u201c is taken entirely from the \u2018 German 's Tale , Kruitzner , \u2019 published ... in Lee 's Canterbury Tales .... I have adopted the characters , plan , and even the language , of many parts of this story . \u201d Kruitzner seems to have made a deep impression on his mind . When he was a boy of thirteen, and again in 1815 , he set himself to turn the tale into a drama . His first attempt , named Ulric and Ilvina , he threw into the fire , but he had nearly completed the first act of his second and maturer adaptation when he was \u201c interrupted by circumstances , \u201d that is , no doubt , the circumstances which led up to and ended in the separation from his wife .On his leaving England for the Continent , April 25 , 1816 , the fragment was left behind . Most probably the MS. fell into his sister 's hands , for in October , 1821 , it was not forthcoming when Byron gave directions that Hobhouse should search for it \u201c amongst my papers . \u201d Ultimately it came into the possession of the late Mr. Murray , and is now printed for the first time in its entiretyIt should be borne in mind that this unprinted first act of Werner , which synchronizes with the Siege of Corinth and Parisina , was written when Byron was a member of the sub-committee of management of Drury Lane Theatre , and , as the numerous stage directions testify , with a view to stage-representation . The MS. is scored with corrections , and betrays an unusual elaboration , and , perhaps , some difficulty and hesitation in the choice of words and the construction of sentences . In the opening scene the situation is not caught and gripped , while the melancholy squalor of the original narrative is only too faithfully reproduced . The Werner of 1821 , with all its shortcomings , is the production of a playwright . The Werner of 1815 is the attempt of a highly gifted amateur . When Byron once more bethought himself of his old subject , he not only sent for the MS. of the first act , but desired Murray \u201c to cut out Sophia Lee 's \u201d\u201c German 's Tale from the Canterbury Tales , and send it in a letter \u201dHe seems to have intended from the first to construct a drama out of the story , and , no doubt , to acknowledge the source of his inspiration . On the whole , he carried out his intention , taking places , characters , and incidents as he found them , but recasting the materials and turning prose into metre . But here and there , to save himself trouble , he \u201c stole his brooms ready made , \u201d and , as he acknowledges in the Preface , \u201c adopted even the language of the story . \u201d Act ii . sc . 2 , lines 87-172 ; act iii . sc . 4 ; and act v. sc . 1 , lines 94-479 , are , more or less , faithful and exact reproductions of pp . 203-206 , 228-232 , and 252-271 of the novelOn the other hand , in the remaining three-fourths of the play , the language is not Miss Lee 's , but Byron 's , and the \u201c conveyance \u201d of incidents occasional and insignificant . Much , too , was imported into the play, of which there is neither hint nor suggestion in the story . Maginn 's categorical statementthat \u201c here Lord Byron has invented nothing \u2014 absolutely , positively , undeniably NOTHING ; \u201d that \u201c there is not one incident in his play , not even the most trivial , that is not to be found in the novel , \u201d etc ., is \u201c positively and undeniably \u201d a falsehood . Maginn read Werner for the purpose of attacking Byron , and , by printing selected passages from the novel and the play , in parallel columns , gives the reader to understand that he had made an exhaustive analysis of the original and the copy . The review , which is quoted as an authority in the editions of 1832and 1837 , etc ., p. 341 , is disingenuous and misleading . The original story may be briefly retold . The prodigal and outlawed son of a Bohemian noble , Count Siegendorf , after various adventures , marries , under the assumed name of Friedrich Kruitzner , the daughter of an Italian scholar and man of science , of noble birth , but in narrow circumstances . A son , Conrad , is born to him , who , at eight years of age , is transferred to the charge of his grandfather . Twelve years go by , and , when the fortunes of the younger Siegendorf are at their lowest ebb , he learns , at the same moment , that his father is dead , and that a distant kinsman , the Baron Stralenheim , is meditating an attack on his person , with a view to claiming his inheritance . Of Conrad , who has disappeared , he hears nothing . An accident compels the count and the baron to occupy adjoining quarters in a small town on the northern frontier of Silesia ; and , again , another accident places the usurping and intriguing baron at the mercy of his poverty-stricken and exiled kinsman . Stralenheim has fallen asleep near the fire in his easy-chair . Papers and several rouleaux of gold are ranged on a cabinet beside the bed . Kruitzner , who is armed with \u201c a large and sharp knife , \u201d is suddenly confronted with his unarmed and slumbering foe , and though habit and conscience conspire to make murder impossible , he yields to a sudden and irresistible impulse , and snatches up \u201c the portion of gold which is nearest . \u201d He has no sooner returned to his wife and confessed his deed , than Conrad suddenly appears on the scene , and at the very moment of an unexpected and joyous reunion with his parents , learns that his father is a thief . Kruitzner pleads \u201c guilty with extenuating circumstances , \u201d and Conrad , who either is or pretends to be disgusted at his father 's sophistries , makes the best of a bad business , and undertakes to conceal his father 's dishonour and rescue him from the power of Stralenheim . The plot hinges on the unlooked-for and unsuspected action of Conrad . Unlike his father , he is not the man to let \u201c I dare not wait upon I would , \u201d but murders Stralenheim in cold blood , and , at the same time , diverts suspicion from his father and himself to the person of his comrade , a Hungarian soldier of fortune , who is already supposed to be the thief , and who had sought and obtained shelter in the apartments of the conscience-stricken Kruitzner . The scene changes to Prague . Siegendorf , no longer Kruitzner , has regained his inheritance , and is once more at the height of splendour and prosperity . A service of thanksgiving is being held in the cathedral to commemorate the signature of the Treaty of Prague, and the count is present in state . Suddenly he catches sight of the Hungarian , and , \u201c like a flash of lightning \u201d feels and remembers that he is a thief , and that he might , however unjustly , be suspected if not accused of the murder of Stralenheim . The service is over , and the count is recrossing \u201c Muldau 's Bridge , \u201d when he hears the fatal word Kruitzner , \u201c the seal of his shame , \u201d spoken in his ear . He returns to his castle , and issues orders that the Hungarian should be arrested and interrogated . An interview takes place , at which the Hungarian denounces Conrad as the murderer of Stralenheim . The son acknowledges the deed , and upbraids the father for his weakness and credulity in supposing that his escape from Stralenheim 's machinations could have been effected by any other means . If , he argues , circumstances can palliate dishonesty , they can compel and justify murder . Common sense even now demands the immediate slaughter of the Hungarian , as it compelled and sanctioned the effectual silencing of Stralenheim . But Siegendorf knows not \u201c thorough , \u201d and shrinks at assassination . He repudiates and denounces his son , and connives at the escape of the Hungarian . Conrad , who is banished from Prague , rejoins his former associates , the \u201c black bands , \u201d which were the scandal and terror of the neighbouring provinces , and is killed in a skirmish with the regular troops . Siegendorf dies of a broken heart . The conception of The German 's Tale , as Byron perceived , is superior to the execution . The style is laboured and involved , and the narrative long-winded and tiresome . It is , perhaps , an adaptation , though not a literal translation , of a German historical romance . But the motif \u2014 a son predestined to evil by the weakness and sensuality of his father , a father punished for his want of rectitude by the passionate criminality of his son , is the very key-note of tragedy . If from haste or indolence Byron scamped his task , and cut up whole cantles of the novel into nerveless and pointless blank verse , here and there throughout the play , in scattered lines and passages , he outdoes himself . The inspiration is fitful , but supreme . Werner was reviewed in Blackwood 's Edinburgh Magazine , December , 1822 , vol . xii . pp . 710-719; in the Scots Magazine , December , 1822 , N. S . vol . xi . pp . 688-694 ; the European Magazine , January , 1823 , vol . 83 , pp . 73-76 ; and in the Eclectic Review , February , 1823 , N. S . vol . xix . pp . 148-155 . NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO WERNER . In an article entitled , \u201c Did Byron write Werner ? \u201d which appeared in the Nineteenth Century, the Hon . F. Leveson Gower undertakes to prove that Werner was not written by Lord Byron , but by Georgiana , Duchess of DevonshireHe adduces , in support of this claim ,a statement made to him by his sister , the late Lady Georgiana Fullerton , to the effect that their grandmother , the duchess , \u201c wrote the poem and gave the MS. to her niece , Lady Caroline Ponsonby, and that she , some years later , handed it over to Lord Byron , who , in 1822 , published it in his own name ; \u201da letter written in 1822 by his mother , Lady Granville , to her sister , Lady Carlisle , which asserts that their mother , the duchess , \u201c wrote an entire tragedy from Miss Lee 's Kreutzner the Hungarian, \u201d and that the MS. had been sent to her by Lady Caroline 's brother , Mr. William Ponsonby , and was in her possession ;another letter of Lady Granville 's , dated December 3 , 1822 , in which she informs her sister that her husband , Lord Granville , had promised to read Werner aloud to her, a promise which , if fulfilled , must have revealed one of two things \u2014 the existence of two dramas based on Miss Lee 's Kruitzner , or the identity of Byron 's version with that of the duchess . Now , argues Mr. Leveson Gower , if Lady Granville had known that two dramas were in existence , she would not have allowed her daughter , Lady Georgiana Fullerton , to believe \u201c that the duchess was the author of the published poem . \u201d I will deal with the external evidence first . Practically it amounts to this :that Lady Granville knew that her mother , the Duchess of Devonshire , dramatized Miss Lee 's Kruitzner ; andthat Lady Georgiana Fullerton believed that the duchess gave the MS. of her play to Lady Caroline Ponsonby , and that , many years after , Lady Caroline handed it over to Byron . The external evidence establishes the fact that the Duchess of Devonshire dramatized Kruitzner , but it does not prove that Byron purloined her adaptation . It records an unverified impression on the part of the duchess 's granddaughter , that the MS. of a play written between the years 1801-1806 , passed into Byron 's hands about the year 1813 ; that he took a copy of the MS .; and that in 1821-22 he caused his copy to be retranscribed and published under his own name ."]}, "act_index": 28, "play_index": 28}, {"data": {"1067": ["A mother 's thanks ! a mother 's tears of joy !", "And how obtained ?\u2014 that knife !", "Have much to think of .", "Or other civic means , to amend thy fortunes .", "Your good intentions .", "Lonely ! my dear husband ?", "Poor creatures ! are you sure ?", "We learn his purpose ?", "Of early delicacy render more 40", "It keeps us here .", "It is nothing : all men ,", "Oh ! he is good !", "But had my birth been all my claim to match 130", "He does not know thy person ; and his spies ,", "Who can it be at this lone hour ?

When Athens all the Grecian slate did guide , And Greece gave laws to all the world beside ; Then Sophocles with Socrates did sit , Supreme in wisdom one , and one in wit : And wit from wisdom differed not in those , But as \u2018 twas sung in verse , or said in prose . Then , OEdipus , on crowded theatres , Drew all admiring eyes and list'ning ears : The pleased spectator shouted every line , The noblest , manliest , and the best design ! And every critic of each learned age , By this just model has reformed the stage . Now , should it fail ,Damn it in silence , lest the world should hear . For were it known this poem did not please , You might set up for perfect savages : Your neighbours would not look on you as men , But think the nation all turned Picts again . Faith , as you manage matters , \u2018 tis not fit You should suspect yourselves of too much wit : Drive not the jest too far , but spare this piece ; And , for this once , be not more wise than Greece . See twice ! do not pell-mell to damning fall , Like true-born Britons , who ne'er think at all : Pray be advised ; and though at Monsyou won , On pointed cannon do not always run . With some respect to ancient wit proceed ; You take the four first councils for your creed . But , when you lay tradition wholly by , And on the private spirit alone rely , You turn fanatics in your poetry . If , notwithstanding all that we can say , You needs will have your penn'orths of the play , And come resolved to damn , because you pay , Record it , in memorial of the fact , The first play buried since the woollen act .

THE PREFACE . The poet \u00c6schylus was held in the same veneration by the Athenians of after-ages , as Shakespeare is by us ; and Longinus has judged , in favour of him , that he had a noble boldness of expression , and that his imaginations were lofty and heroic ; but , on the other side , Quintilian affirms , that he was daring to extravagance . It is certain , that he affected pompous words , and that his sense was obscured by figures ; notwithstanding these imperfections , the value of his writings after his decease was such , that his countrymen ordained an equal reward to those poets , who could alter his plays to be acted on the theatre , with those whose productions were wholly new , and of their own . The case is not the same in England ; though the difficulties of altering are greater , and our reverence for Shakespeare much more just , than that of the Grecians for \u00c6schylus . In the age of that poet , the Greek tongue was arrived to its full perfection ; they had then amongst them an exact standard of writing and of speaking : the English language is not capable of such a certainty ; and we are at present so far from it , that we are wanting in the very foundation of it , a perfect grammar . Yet it must be allowed to the present age , that the tongue in general is so much refined since Shakespeare 's time , that many of his words , and more of his phrases , are scarce intelligible . And of those which we understand , some are ungrammatical , others coarse ; and his whole style is so pestered with figurative expressions , that it is as affected as it is obscure . It is true , that in his latter plays he had worn off somewhat of the rust ; but the tragedy , which I have undertaken to correct , was in all probability one of his first endeavours on the stage . The original story was written by one Lollius a Lombard , in Latin verse , and translated by Chaucer into English ; intended , I suppose , a satire on the inconstancy of women : I find nothing of it among the ancients ; not so much as the name Cressida once mentioned . Shakespeare ,in the apprenticeship of his writing , modelled it into that play , which is now called by the name of \u201c Troilus and Cressida , \u201d but so lamely is it left to us , that it is not divided into acts ; which fault I ascribe to the actors who printed it after Shakespeare 's death ; and that too so carelessly , that a more uncorrected copy I never saw . For the play itself , the author seems to have begun it with some fire ; the characters of Pandarus and Thersites , are promising enough ; but as if he grew weary of his task , after an entrance or two , he lets them fall : and the latter part of the tragedy is nothing but a confusion of drums and trumpets , excursions and alarms . The chief persons , who give name to the tragedy , are left alive ; Cressida is false , and is not punished . Yet , after all , because the play was Shakespeare 's , and that there appeared in some places of it the admirable genius of the author , I undertook to remove that heap of rubbish under which many excellent thoughts lay wholly buried . Accordingly , I new modelled the plot , threw out many unnecessary persons , improved those characters which were begun and left unfinished , as Hector , Troilus , Pandarus , and Thersites , and added that of Andromache . After this , I made , with no small trouble , an order and connection of all the scenes ; removing them from the places where they were inartificially set ; and , though it was impossible to keep them all unbroken , because the scene must be sometimes in the city and sometimes in the camp , yet I have so ordered them , that there is a coherence of them with one another , and a dependence on the main design ; no leaping from Troy to the Grecian tents , and thence back again , in the same act , but a due proportion of time allowed for every motion . I need not say that I have refined his language , which before was obsolete ; but I am willing to acknowledge , that as I have often drawn his English nearer to our times , so I have sometimes conformed my own to his ; and consequently , the language is not altogether so pure as it is significant . The scenes of Pandarus and Cressida , of Troilus and Pandarus , of Andromache with Hector and the Trojans , in the second act , are wholly new ; together with that of Nestor and Ulysses with Thersites , and that of Thersites with Ajax and Achilles . I will not weary my reader with the scenes which are added of Pandarus and the lovers , in the third , and those of Thersites , which are wholly altered ; but I cannot omit the last scene in it , which is almost half the act , betwixt Troilus and Hector . The occasion of raising it was hinted to me by Mr Betterton ; the contrivance and working of it was my own . They who think to do me an injury , by saying , that it is an imitation of the scene betwixt Brutus and Cassius , do me an honour , by supposing I could imitate the incomparable Shakespeare ; but let me add , that if Shakespeare 's scene , or that faulty copy of it in \u201c Amintor and Melantius , \u201d had never been , yet Euripides had furnished me with an excellent example in his \u201c Iphigenia , \u201d between Agamemnon and Menelaus ; and from thence , indeed , the last turn of it is borrowed . The occasion which Shakespeare , Euripides , and Fletcher , have all taken , is the same ,\u2014 grounded upon friendship ; and the quarrel of two virtuous men , raised by natural degrees to the extremity of passion , is conducted in all three , to the declination of the same passion , and concludes with a warm renewing of their friendship . But the particular ground-work which Shakespeare has taken , is incomparably the best ; because he has not only chosen two of the greatest heroes of their age , but has likewise interested the liberty of Rome , and their own honours , who were the redeemers of it , in this debate . And if he has made Brutus , who was naturally a patient man , to fly into excess at first , let it be remembered in his defence , that , just before , he has received the news of Portia 's death ; whom the poet , on purpose neglecting a little chronology , supposes to have died before Brutus , only to give him an occasion of being more easily exasperated . Add to this , that the injury he had received from Cassius , had long been brooding in his mind ; and that a melancholy man , upon consideration of an affront , especially from a friend , would be more eager in his passion , than he who had given it , though naturally more choleric . Euripides , whom I have followed , has raised the quarrel betwixt two brothers , who were friends . The foundation of the scene was this : The Grecians were wind-bound at the port of Aulis , and the oracle had said , that they could not sail , unless Agamemnon delivered up his daughter to be sacrificed : he refuses ; his brother Menelaus urges the public safety ; the father defends himself by arguments of natural affection , and hereupon they quarrel . Agamemnon is at last convinced , and promises to deliver up Iphigenia , but so passionately laments his loss , that Menelaus is grieved to have been the occasion of it , and , by a return of kindness , offers to intercede for him with the Grecians , that his daughter might not be sacrificed . But my friend Mr Rymer has so largely , and with so much judgment , described this scene , in comparing it with that of Melantius and Amintor , that it is superfluous to say more of it ; I only named the heads of it , that any reasonable man might judge it was from thence I modelled my scene betwixt Troilus and Hector . I will conclude my reflections on it , with a passage of Longinus , concerning Plato 's imitation of Homer : \u201c We ought not to regard a good imitation as a theft , but as a beautiful idea of him who undertakes to imitate , by forming himself on the invention and the work of another man ; for he enters into the lists like a new wrestler , to dispute the prize with the former champion . This sort of emulation , says Hesiod , is honourable ,\u2014 when we combat for victory with a hero , and are not without glory even in our overthrow . Those great men , whom we propose to ourselves as patterns of our imitation , serve us as a torch , which is lifted up before us , to enlighten our passage , and often elevate our thoughts as high as the conception we have of our author 's genius . \u201d I have been so tedious in three acts , that I shall contract myself in the two last . The beginning scenes of the fourth act are either added or changed wholly by me ; the middle of it is Shakespeare altered , and mingled with my own ; three or four of the last scenes are altogether new . And the whole fifth act , both the plot and the writing , are my own additions . But having written so much for imitation of what is excellent , in that part of the preface which related only to myself , methinks it would neither be unprofitable nor unpleasant to inquire how far we ought to imitate our own poets , Shakespeare and Fletcher , in their tragedies ; and this will occasion another inquiry , how those two writers differ between themselves : but since neither of these questions can be solved , unless some measures be first taken , by which we may be enabled to judge truly of their writings , I shall endeavour , as briefly as I can , to discover the grounds and reason of all criticism , applying them in this place only to Tragedy . Aristotle with his interpreters , and Horace , and Longinus , are the authors to whom I owe my lights ; and what part soever of my own plays , or of this , which no mending could make regular , shall fall under the condemnation of such judges , it would be impudence in me to defend . I think it no shame to retract my errors , and am well pleased to suffer in the cause , if the art may be improved at my expence : I therefore proceed to THE GROUNDS OF CRITICISM IN TRAGEDY . Tragedy is thus defined by AristotleIt is an imitation of one entire , great , and probable action ; not told , but represented ; which , by moving in us fear and pity , is conducive to the purging of those two passions in our minds . More largely thus : Tragedy describes or paints an action , which action must have all the properties above named . First , it must be one or single ; that is , it must not be a history of one man 's life , suppose of Alexander the Great , or Julius C\u00e6sar , but one single action of theirs . This condemns all Shakespeare 's historical plays , which are rather chronicles represented , than tragedies ; and all double action of plays . As , to avoid a satire upon others , I will make bold with my own \u201c Marriage A-la-mode , \u201d where there are manifestly two actions , not depending on one another ; but in \u201c OEdipus \u201d there cannot properly be said to be two actions , because the love of Adrastus and Eurydice has a necessary dependence on the principal design into which it is woven . The natural reason of this rule is plain ; for two different independent actions distract the attention and concernment of the audience , and consequently destroy the intention of the poet ; if his business be to move terror and pity , and one of his actions he comical , the other tragical , the former will divert the people , and utterly make void his greater purpose . Therefore , as in perspective , so in tragedy , there must be a point of sight in which all the lines terminate ; otherwise the eye wanders , and the work is false . This was the practice of the Grecian stage . But Terence made an innovation in the Roman : all his plays have double actions ; for it was his custom to translate two Greek comedies , and to weave them into one of his , yet so , that both their actions were comical , and one was principal , the other but secondary or subservient . And this has obtained on the English stage , to give us the pleasure of variety . As the action ought to be one , it ought , as such , to have order in it ; that is , to have a natural beginning , a middle , and an end . A natural beginning , says Aristotle , is that which could not necessarily have been placed after another thing ; and so of the rest . This consideration will arraign all plays after the new model of Spanish plots , where accident is heaped upon accident , and that which is first might as reasonably be last ; an inconvenience not to be remedied , but by making one accident naturally produce another , otherwise it is a farce and not a play . Of this nature is the \u201c Slighted Maid ; \u201d where there is no scene in the first act , which might not by as good reason be in the fifth . And if the action ought to be one , the tragedy ought likewise to conclude with the action of it . Thus in \u201c Mustapha , \u201d the play should naturally have ended with the death of Zanger , and not have given us the grace-cup after dinner , of Solyman 's divorce from Roxolana . The following properties of the action are so easy , that they need not my explaining . It ought to be great , and to consist of great persons , to distinguish it from comedy , where the action is trivial , and the persons of inferior rank . The last quality of the action is , that it ought to be probable , as well as admirable and great . It is not necessary that there should be historical truth in it ; but always necessary that there should be a likeness of truth , something that is more than barely possible ; probable being that which succeeds , or happens , oftener than it misses . To invent therefore a probability and to make it wonderful , is the most difficult undertaking in the art of poetry ; for that , which is not wonderful , is not great ; and that , which is not probable , will not delight a reasonable audience . This action , thus described , must be represented and not told , to distinguish dramatic poetry from epic : but I hasten to the end or scope of tragedy , which is , to rectify or purge our passions , fear and pity . To instruct delightfully is the general end of all poetry . Philosophy instructs , but it performs its work by precept ; which is not delightful , or not so delightful as example . To purge the passions by example , is therefore the particular instruction which belongs to tragedy . Rapin , a judicious critic , has observed from Aristotle , that pride and want of commiseration are the most predominant vices in mankind ; therefore , to cure us of these two , the inventors of tragedy have chosen to work upon two other passions , which are , fear and pity . We are wrought to fear , by their setting before our eyes some terrible example of misfortune , which happened to persons of the highest quality ; for such an action demonstrates to us , that no condition is privileged from the turns of fortune ; this must of necessity cause terror in us , and consequently abate our pride . But when we see that the most virtuous , as well as the greatest , are not exempt from such misfortunes , that consideration moves pity in us , and insensibly works us to be helpful to , and tender over , the distressed ; which is the noblest and most godlike of moral virtues , Here it is observable , that it is absolutely necessary to make a man virtuous , if we desire he should be pitied : we lament not , but detest , a wicked man ; we are glad when we behold his crimes are punished , and that poetical justice is done upon him . Euripides was censured by the critics of his time , for making his chief characters too wicked ; for example , Ph\u00e6dra , though she loved her son-in-law with reluctancy , and that it was a curse upon her family for offending Venus , yet was thought too ill a pattern for the stage . Shall we therefore banish all characters of villainy ? I confess I am not of that opinion ; but it is necessary that the hero of the play be not a villain ; that is , the characters , which should move our pity , ought to have virtuous inclinations , and degrees of moral goodness in them . As for a perfect character of virtue , it never was in nature , and therefore there can be no imitation of it ; but there are allays of frailty to be allowed for the chief persons , yet so that the good which is in them shall outweigh the bad , and consequently leave room for punishment on the one side , and pity on the other . After all , if any one will ask me , whether a tragedy cannot be made upon any other grounds than those of exciting pity and terror in us ;\u2014 Bossu , the best of modern critics , answers thus in general : That all excellent arts , and particularly that of poetry , have been invented and brought to perfection by men of a transcendent genius ; and that , therefore , they , who practise afterwards the same arts , are obliged to tread in their footsteps , and to search in their writings the foundation of them ; for it is not just that new rules should destroy the authority of the old . But Rapin writes more particularly thus , that no passions in a story are so proper to move our concernment , as fear and pity ; and that it is from our concernment we receive our pleasure , is undoubted . When the soul becomes agitated with fear for one character , or hope for another ; then it is that we are pleased in tragedy , by the interest which we take in their adventures . Here , therefore , the general answer may be given to the first question , how far we ought to imitate Shakespeare and Fletcher in their plots ; namely , that we ought to follow them so far only , as they have copied the excellencies of those who invented and brought to perfection dramatic poetry ; those things only excepted , which religion , custom of countries , idioms of languages , & c. have altered in the superstructures , but not in the foundation of the design . How defective Shakespeare and Fletcher have been in all their plots , Mr Rymer has discovered in his criticisms . Neither can we , who follow them , be excused from the same , or greater errors ; which are the more unpardonable in us , because we want their beauties to countervail our faults . The best of their designs , the most approaching to antiquity , and the most conducing to move pity , is the \u201c King and no King ; \u201d which , if the farce of Bessus were thrown away , is of that inferior sort of tragedies , which end with a prosperous event . It is probably derived from the story of OEdipus , with the character of Alexander the Great , in his extravagances , given to Arbaces . The taking of this play , amongst many others , I cannot wholly ascribe to the excellency of the action ; for I find it moving when it is read . It is true , the faults of the plot are so evidently proved , that they can no longer be denied . The beauties of it must therefore lie either in the lively touches of the passion ; or we must conclude , as I think we may , that even in imperfect plots there are less degrees of nature , by which some faint emotions of pity and terror are raised in us ; as a less engine will raise a less proportion of weight , though not so much as one of Archimedes 's making ; for nothing can move our nature , but by some natural reason , which works upon passions . And , since we acknowledge the effect , there must be something in the cause . The difference between Shakespeare and Fletcher , in their plottings , seems to be this ; that Shakespeare generally moves more terror , and Fletcher more compassion : for the first had a more masculine , a bolder , and more fiery genius ; the second , a more soft and womanish . In the mechanic beauties of the plot , which are the observation of the three unities , time , place , and action , they are both deficient ; but Shakespeare most . Ben Jonson reformed those errors in his comedies , yet one of Shakespeare 's was regular before him ; which is , \u201c The Merry Wives of Windsor . \u201d For what remains concerning the design , you are to be referred to our English critic . That method which he has prescribed to raise it , from mistake , or ignorance of the crime , is certainly the best , though it is not the only ; for amongst all the tragedies of Sophocles , there is but one , OEdipus , which is wholly built after that model . After the plot , which is the foundation of the play , the next thing to which we ought to apply our judgment , is the manners ; for now the poet comes to work above ground . The ground-work , indeed , is that which is most necessary , as that upon which depends the firmness of the whole fabric ; yet it strikes not the eye so much , as the beauties or imperfections of the manners , the thoughts , and the expressions . The first rule which Bossu prescribes to the writer of an heroic poem , and which holds too by the same reason in all dramatic poetry , is to make the moral of the work ; that is , to lay down to yourself what that precept of morality shall be , which you would insinuate into the people ; as , namely , Homer 'swas , that union preserves a commonwealth and discord destroys it . Sophocles , in his OEdipus , that no man is to be accounted happy before his death . It is the moral that directs the whole action of the play to one centre ; and that action or fable is the example built upon the moral , which confirms the truth of it to our experience . When the fable is designed , then , and not before , the persons are to be introduced , with their manners , characters , and passions . The manners , in a poem , are understood to be those inclinations , whether natural or acquired , which move and carry us to actions , good , bad , or indifferent , in a play ; or which incline the persons to such or such actions . I have anticipated part of this discourse already , in declaring that a poet ought not to make the manners perfectly good in his best persons ; but neither are they to be more wicked in any of his characters , than necessity requires . To produce a villain , without other reason than a natural inclination to villainy , is , in poetry , to produce an effect without a cause ; and to make him more a villain than he has just reason to be , is to make an effect which is stronger than the cause . The manners arise from many causes ; and are either distinguished by complexion , as choleric and phlegmatic , or by the differences of age or sex , of climates , or quality of the persons , or their present condition . They are likewise to be gathered from the several virtues , vices , or passions , and many other common-places , which a poet must be supposed to have learned from natural philosophy , ethics , and history ; of all which , whosoever is ignorant , does not deserve the name of poet . But as the manners are useful in this art , they may be all comprised under these general heads : First , they must be apparent ; that is , in every character of the play , some inclinations of the person must appear ; and these are shown in the actions and discourse . Secondly , the manners must be suitable , or agreeing to the persons ; that is , to the age , sex , dignity , and the other general heads of manners : thus , when a poet has given the dignity of a king to one of his persons , in all his actions and speeches , that person must discover majesty , magnanimity , and jealousy of power , because these are suitable to the general manners of a kingThe third property of manners is resemblance ; and this is founded upon the particular characters of men , as we have them delivered to us by relation or history ; that is , when a poet has the known character of this or that man before him , he is bound to represent him such , at least not contrary to that which fame has reported him to have been . Thus , it is not a poet 's choice to make Ulysses choleric , or Achilles patient , because Homer has described them quite otherwise . Yet this is a rock , on which ignorant writers daily split ; and the absurdity is as monstrous , as if a painter should draw a coward running from a battle , and tell us it was the picture of Alexander the Great . The last property of manners is , that they be constant and equal , that is , maintained the same through the whole design : thus , when Virgil had once given the name of pious to \u00c6neas , he was bound to show him such , in all his words and actions through the whole poem . All these properties Horace has hinted to a judicious observer .\u2014 1 . Notandi sunt tibi mores ; 2 . Aut famam sequere , 3. aut sibi concenientia finge ; 4 . Sercetur ad imum , qualis ab incepto processerit , et sibi constet . From the manners , the characters of persons are derived ; for , indeed , the characters are no other than the inclinations , as they appear in the several persons of the poem ; a character being thus defined ,\u2014 that which distinguishes one man from another . Not to repeat the same things over again , which have been said of the manners , I will only add what is necessary here . A character , or that which distinguishes one man from all others , cannot be supposed to consist of one particular virtue , or vice , or passion only ; but it is a composition of qualities which are not contrary to one another in the same person . Thus , the same man may be liberal and valiant , but not liberal and covetous ; so in a comical character , or humour ,Falstaff is a liar , and a coward , a glutton , and a buffoon , because all these qualities may agree in the same man ; yet it is still to be observed , that one virtue , vice , and passion , ought to be shown in every man , as predominant over all the rest ; as covetousness in Crassus , love of his country in Brutus ; and the same in characters which are feigned . The chief character or hero in a tragedy , as I have already shown , ought in prudence to be such a man , who has so much more of virtue in him than of vice , that he may be left amiable to the audience , which otherwise cannot have any concernment for his sufferings ; and it is on this one character , that the pity and terror must be principally , if not wholly , founded : a rule which is extremely necessary , and which none of the critics , that I know , have fully enough discovered to us . For terror and compassion work but weakly when they are divided into many persons . If Creon had been the chief character in \u201c OEdipus , \u201d there had neither been terror nor compassion moved ; but only detestation of the man , and joy for his punishment ; if Adrastus and Eurydice had been made more appearing characters , then the pity had been divided , and lessened on the part of OEdipus . But making OEdipus the best and bravest person , and even Jocasta but an underpart to him , his virtues , and the punishment of his fatal crime , drew both the pity , and the terror to himself . By what has been said of the manners , it will be easy for a reasonable man to judge , whether the characters be truly or falsely drawn in a tragedy ; for if there be no manners appearing in the characters , no concernment for the persons can be raised ; no pity or horror can be moved , but by vice or virtue ; therefore , without them , no person can have any business in the play . If the inclinations be obscure , it is a sign the poet is in the dark , and knows not what manner of man he presents to you ; and consequently you can have no idea , or very imperfect , of that man ; nor can judge what resolutions he ought to take ; or what words or actions are proper for him . Most comedies , made up of accidents or adventures , are liable to fall into this error ; and tragedies with many turns are subject to it ; for the manners can never be evident , where the surprises of fortune take up all the business of the stage ; and where the poet is more in pain , to tell you what happened to such a man , than what he was . It is one of the excellencies of Shakespeare , that the manners of his persons are generally apparent ; and you see their bent and inclinations . Fletcher comes far short of him in this , as indeed he does almost in every thing . There are but glimmerings of manners in most of his comedies , which run upon adventures ; and in his tragedies , Rollo , Otto , the King and no King , Melantius , and many others of his best , are but pictures shown you in the twilight ; you know not whether they resemble vice or virtue , and they are either good , bad , or indifferent , as the present scene requires it . But of all poets , this commendation is to be given to Ben Jonson , that the manners even of the most inconsiderable persons in his plays , are every where apparent . By considering the second quality of manners , which is , that they be suitable to the age , quality , country , dignity , & c. of the character , we may likewise judge whether a poet has followed nature . In this kind , Sophocles and Euripides have more excelled among the Greeks than \u00c6schylus ; and Terence more than Plautus , among the Romans . Thus , Sophocles gives to OEdipus the true qualities of a king , in both those plays which bear his name ; but in the latter , which is the \u201c OEdipus Coloneus , \u201d he lets fall on purpose his tragic style ; his hero speaks not in the arbitrary tone ; but remembers , in the softness of his complaints , that he is an unfortunate blind old man ; that he is banished from his country , and persecuted by his next relations . The present French poets are generally accused , that wheresoever they lay the scene , or in whatsoever age , the manners of their heroes are wholly French . Racine 's Bajazet is bred at Constantinople ; but his civilities are conveyed to him , by some secret passage , from Versailles into the seraglio . But our Shakespeare , having ascribed to Henry the Fourth the character of a king and of a father , gives him the perfect manners of each relation , when either he transacts with his son or with his subjects . Fletcher , on the other side , gives neither to Arbaces , nor to his king , in \u201c The Maid 's Tragedy , \u201d the qualities which are suitable to a monarch ; though he may be excused a little in the latter , for the king there is not uppermost in the character ; it is the lover of Evadne , who is king only in a second consideration ; and though he be unjust , and has other faults which shall be nameless , yet he is not the hero of the play . It is true , we find him a lawful prince ,and therefore Mr Rymer 's criticism stands good ,\u2014 that he should not be shown in so vicious a character . Sophocles has been more judicious in his \u201c Antigona ; \u201d for , though he represents in Creon a bloody prince , yet he makes him not a lawful king , but an usurper , and Antigona herself is the heroine of the tragedy : but when Philaster wounds Arethusa and the boy ; and Perigot his mistress , in the \u201c Faithful Shepherdess , \u201d both these are contrary to the character of manhood . Nor is Valentinian managed much better ; for , though Fletcher has taken his picture truly , and shown him as he was , an effeminate , voluptuous man , yet he has forgotten that he was an emperor , and has given him none of those royal marks , which ought to appear in a lawful successor of the throne . If it be enquired , what Fletcher should have done on this occasion ; ought he not to have represented Valentinian as he was ;\u2014 Bossu shall answer this question for me , by an instance of the like nature : Mauritius , the Greek emperor , was a prince far surpassing Valentinian , for he was endued with many kingly virtues ; he was religious , merciful , and valiant , but withal he was noted of extreme covetousness , a vice which is contrary to the character of a hero , or a prince : therefore , says the critic , that emperor was no fit person to be represented in a tragedy , unless his good qualities were only to be shown , and his covetousnesswere slurred over by the artifice of the poet . To return once more to Shakespeare ; no man ever drew so many characters , or generally distinguished them better from one another , excepting only Jonson . I will instance but in one , to show the copiousness of his invention ; it is that of Caliban , or the monster , in \u201c The Tempest . \u201d He seems there to have created a person which was not in nature , a boldness which , at first sight , would appear intolerable ; for he makes him a species of himself , begotten by an incubus on a witch ; but this , as I have elsewhere proved , is not wholly beyond the bounds of credibility , at least the vulgar still believe it . We have the separated notions of a spirit , and of a witch ;therefore , as from the distinct apprehensions of a horse , and of a man , imagination has formed a centaur ; so , from those of an incubus and a sorceress , Shakespeare has produced his monster . Whether or no his generation can be defended , I leave to philosophy ; but of this I am certain , that the poet has most judiciously furnished him with a person , a language , and a character , which will suit him , both by father 's and mother 's side : he has all the discontents , and malice of a witch , and of a devil , besides a convenient proportion of the deadly sins ; gluttony , sloth , and lust , are manifest ; the dejectedness of a slave is likewise given him , and the ignorance of one bred up in a desert island . His person is monstrous , and he is the product of unnatural lust ; and his language is as hobgoblin as his person ; in all things he is distinguished from other mortals . The characters of Fletcher are poor and narrow , in comparison of Shakspeare 's ; I remember not one which is not borrowed from him ; unless you will except that strange mixture of a man in the \u201c King and no King ; \u201d so that in this part Shakespeare is generally worth our imitation ; and to imitate Fletcher is but to copy after him who was a copyer . Under this general head of manners , the passions are naturally included , as belonging to the characters . I speak not of pity and of terror , which are to be moved in the audience by the plot ; but of anger , hatred , love , ambition , jealousy , revenge , & c. as they are shown in this or that person of the play . To describe these naturally , and to move them artfully , is one of the greatest commendations which can be given to a poet : to write pathetically , says Longinus , cannot proceed but from a lofty genius . A poet must be born with this quality : yet , unless he help himself by an acquired knowledge of the passions , what they are in their own nature , and by what springs they are to be moved , he will be subject either to raise them where they ought not to be raised , or not to raise them by the just degrees of nature , or to amplify them beyond the natural bounds , or not to observe the crisis and turns of them , in their cooling and decay ; all which errors proceed from want of judgment in the poet , and from being unskilled in the principles of moral philosophy . Nothing is more frequent in a fanciful writer , than to foil himself by not managing his strength ; therefore , as , in a wrestler , there is first required some measure of force , a well-knit body and active limbs , without which all instruction would be vain ; yet , these being granted , if he want the skill which is necessary to a wrestler , he shall make but small advantage of his natural robustuousness : so , in a poet , his inborn vehemence and force of spirit will only run him out of breath the sooner , if it be not supported by the help of art . The roar of passion , indeed , may please an audience , three parts of which are ignorant enough to think all is moving which is noisy , and it may stretch the lungs of an ambitious actor , who will die upon the spot for a thundering clap ; but it will move no other passion than indignation and contempt from judicious men . Longinus , whom I have hitherto followed , continues thus :\u2014 If the passions be artfully employed , the discourse becomes vehement and lofty : if otherwise , there is nothing more ridiculous than a great passion out of season : and to this purpose he animadverts severely upon \u00c6schylus , who writ nothing in cold blood , but was always in a rapture , and in fury with his audience : the inspiration was still upon him , he was ever tearing it upon the tripos ; orhe was always at high-flood of passion , even in the dead ebb , and lowest water-mark of the scene . He who would raise the passion of a judicious audience , says a learned critic , must be sure to take his hearers along with him ; if they be in a calm , \u2018 tis in vain for him to be in a huff : he must move them by degrees , and kindle with them ; otherwise he will be in danger of setting his own heap of stubble on fire , and of burning out by himself , without warming the company that stand about him . They who would justify the madness of poetry from the authority of Aristotle , have mistaken the text , and consequently the interpretation : I imagine it to be false read , where he says of poetry , that it is, that it had always somewhat in it either of a genius , or of a madman . \u2018 Tis more probable that the original ran thus , that poetry was, That it belongs to a witty man , but not to a madman . Thus then the passions , as they are considered simply and in themselves , suffer violence when they are perpetually maintained at the same height ; for what melody can be made on that instrument , all whose strings are screwed up at first to their utmost stretch , and to the same sound ? But this is not the worst : for the characters likewise bear a part in the general calamity , if you consider the passions as embodied in them ; for it follows of necessity , that no man can be distinguished from another by his discourse , when every man is ranting , swaggering , and exclaiming with the same excess : as if it were the only business of all the characters to contend with each other for the prize at Billingsgate ; or that the scene of the tragedy lay in Bethlem . Suppose the poet should intend this man to be choleric , and that man to be patient ; yet when they are confounded in the writing , you cannot distinguish them from one another : for the man who was called patient and tame , is only so before he speaks ; but let his clack be set a-going , and he shall tongue it as impetuously and as loudly , as the arrantest hero in the play . By this means , the characters are only distinct in name ; but , in reality , all the men and women in the play are the same person . No man should pretend to write , who cannot temper his fancy with his judgment : nothing is more dangerous to a raw horseman , than a hot-mouthed jade without a curb . It is necessary therefore for a poet , who would concern an audience by describing of a passion , first to prepare it , and not to rush upon it all at once . Ovid has judiciously shown the difference of these two ways , in the speeches of Ajax and Ulysses : Ajax , from the very beginning , breaks out into his exclamations , and is swearing by his Maker ,\u2014 Agimus , proh Jupiter , inquit . Ulysses , on the contrary , prepares his audience with all the submissiveness he can practise , and all the calmness of a reasonable man ; he found his judges in a tranquillity of spirit , and therefore set out leisurely and softly with them , till he had warmed them by degrees ; and then he began to mend his pace , and to draw them along with his own impetuousness : yet so managing his breath , that it might not fail him at his need , and reserving his utmost proofs of ability even to the last . The success , you see , was answerable ; for the crowd only applauded the speech of Ajax ;\u2014 Vulgique secutum ultima murmur erat :\u2014 But the judges awarded the prize , for which they contended , to Ulysses ; Mota manus procerum est ; et quid facundia posset Tum patuit , fortisque viri tulit arma disertus . The next necessary rule is , to put nothing into the discourse , which may hinder your moving of the passions . Too many accidents , as I have said , incumber the poet , as much as the arms of Saul did David ; for the variety of passions , which they produce , are ever crossing and justling each other out of the way . He , who treats of joy and grief together , is in a fair way of causing neither of those effects . There is yet another obstacle to be removed , which is ,\u2014 pointed wit , and sentences affected out of season ; these are nothing of kin to the violence of passion : no man is at leisure to make sentences and similes , when his soul is in an agony . I the rather name this fault , that it may serve to mind me of my former errors ; neither will I spare myself , but give an example of this kind from my \u201c Indian Emperor . \u201d Montezuma , pursued by his enemies , and seeking sanctuary , stands parleying without the fort , and describing his danger to Cydaria , in a simile of six lines ; As on the sands the frighted traveller Sees the high seas come rolling from afar , & c . My Indian potentate was well skilled in the sea for an inland prince , and well improved since the first act , when he sent his son to discover it . The image had not been amiss from another man , at another time : Sed nunc non erat his locus : he destroyed the concernment which the audience might otherwise have had for him ; for they could not think the danger near , when he had the leisure to invent a simile . If Shakespeare be allowed , as I think he must , to have made his characters distinct , it will easily be inferred , that he understood the nature of the passions : because it has been proved already , that confused passions make distinguishable characters : yet I cannot deny that he has his failings ; but they are not so much in the passions themselves , as in his manner of expression : he often obscures his meaning by his words , and sometimes makes it unintelligible . I will not say of so great a poet , that he distinguished not the blown puffy stile , from true sublimity ; but I may venture to maintain , that the fury of his fancy often transported him beyond the bounds of judgment , either in coining of new words and phrases , or racking words which were in use , into the violence of a catachresis . It is not that I would explode the use of metaphors from passion , for Longinus thinks them necessary to raise it : but to use them at every word , to say nothing without a metaphor , a simile , an image , or description ; is , I doubt , to smell a little too strongly of the buskin . I must be forced to give an example of expressing passion figuratively ; but that I may do it with respect to Shakespeare , it shall not be taken from any thing of his : it is an exclamation against Fortune , quoted in his Hamlet , but written by some other poet : Out , out , thou strumpet Fortune ! all you gods , In general synod , take away her power ; Break all the spokes and felleys from her wheel , And bowl the round nave down the hill of heav'n , As low as to the fiends . And immediately after , speaking of Hecuba , when Priam was killed before her eyes : But who , ah woe ! had seen the mobled queen Run barefoot up and down , threatening the flame With bisson rheum ; a clout about that head , Where late the diadem stood ; and , for a rob About her lank and all o'erhYpppHeNteemed loins , A blanket in th \u2019 alarm of fear caught up . Who this had seen , with tongue in venom steep 'd \u2018 Gainst fortune 's state would treason have pronounc 'd ; But if the gods themselves did see her then , When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport In mincing with his sword her husband 's limbs , The instant burst of clamour that she madeWould have made milch the burning eyes of heaven , And passion in the gods . What a pudder is here kept in raising the expression of trifling thoughts ! would not a man have thought that the poet had been bound prentice to a wheel-wright , for his first rant ? and had followed a rag-man , for the clout and blanket , in the second ? Fortune is painted on a wheel , and therefore the writer , in a rage , will have poetical justice done upon every member of that engine : after this execution , he bowls the nave down-hill , from heaven , to the fiends :\u2018 tis well there are no solid orbs to stop it in the way , or no element of fire to consume it : but when it came to the earth , it must be monstrous heavy , to break ground as low as the center . His making milch the burning eyes of heaven , was a pretty tolerable flight too : and I think no man ever drew milk out of eyes before him : yet , to make the wonder greater , these eyes were burning . Such a sight indeed were enough to have raised passion in the gods ; but to excuse the effects of it , he tells you , perhaps they did not see it . Wise men would be glad to find a little sense couched under all these pompous words ; for bombast is commonly the delight of that audience , which loves poetry , but understands it not : and as commonly has been the practice of those writers , who , not being able to infuse a natural passion into the mind , have made it their business to ply the ears , and to stun their judges by the noise . But Shakespeare does not often thus ; for the passions in his scene between Brutus and Cassius are extremely natural , the thoughts are such as arise from the matter , the expression of them not viciously figurative . I cannot leave this subject , before I do justice to that divine poet , by giving you one of his passionate descriptions : \u2018 tis of Richard the Second when he was deposed , and led in triumph through the streets of London by Henry of Bolingbroke : the painting of it is so lively , and the words so moving that I have scarce read any thing comparable to it , in any other language . Suppose you have seen already the fortunate usurper passing through the crowd , and followed by the shouts and acclamations of the people ; and now behold King Richard entering upon the scene : consider the wretchedness of his condition , and his carriage in it ; and refrain from pity , if you can : As in a theatre , the eyes of men , After a well-grac 'd actor leaves the stage , Are idly bent on him that enters next , Thinking his prattle to be tedious : Even so , or with much more contempt , men 's eyes Did scowl on Richard : no man cry 'd , God save him : No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home , But dust was thrown upon his sacred head , Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off , His face still combating with tears and smiles ,That had not Godsteel 'd The hearts of men , they must perforce have melted , And barbarism itself have pitied him . To speak justly of this whole matter : it is neither height of thought that is discommended , nor pathetic vehemence , nor any nobleness of expression in its proper place ; but it is a false measure of all these , something which is like them , and is not them : it is the Bristol-stone , which appears like a diamond ; it is an extravagant thought , instead of a sublime one ; it is roaring madness , instead of vehemence ; and a sound of words , instead of sense . If Shakespeare were stripped of all the bombasts in his passions , and dressed in the most vulgar words , we should find the beauties of his thoughts remaining ; if his embroideries were burnt down , there would still be silver at the bottom of the melting-pot : but I fearthat we , who ape his sounding words , have nothing of his thought , but are all outside ; there is not so much as a dwarf within our giant 's clothes . Therefore , let not Shakespeare suffer for our sakes ; it is our fault , who succeed him in an age which is more refined , if we imitate him so ill , that we copy his failings only , and make a virtue of that in our writings , which in his was an imperfection . For what remains , the excellency of that poet was , as I have said , in the more manly passions ; Fletcher 's in the softer : Shakespeare writ better betwixt man and man ; Fletcher , betwixt man and woman : consequently , the one described friendship better ; the other love : yet Shakespeare taught Fletcher to write love : and Juliet and Desdemona are originals . It is true , the scholar had the softer soul ; but the master had the kinder . Friendship is both a virtue and a passion essentially ; love is a passion only in its nature , and is not a virtue but by accident : good nature makes friendship ; but effeminacy love . Shakespeare had an universal mind , which comprehended all characters and passions ; Fletcher a more confined and limited : for though he treated love in perfection , yet honour , ambition , revenge , and generally all the stronger , passions , he either touched not , or not masterly . To conclude all , he was a limb of Shakespeare . I had intended to have proceeded to the last property of manners , which is , that they must be constant , and the characters maintained the same from the beginning to the end ; and from thence to have proceeded to the thoughts and expressions suitable to a tragedy : but I will first see how this will relish with the age . It is , I confess , but cursorily written ; yet the judgment , which is given here , is generally founded upon experience : but because many men are shocked at the name of rules , as if they were a kind of magisterial prescription upon poets , I will conclude with the words of Rapin , in his Reflections on Aristotle 's Work of Poetry : \u201c If the rules be well considered , we shall find them to be made only to reduce nature into method , to trace her step by step , and not to suffer the least mark of her to escape us : it is only by these , that probability in fiction is maintained , which is the soul of poetry . They are founded upon good sense , and sound reason , rather than on authority ; for though Aristotle and Horace are produced , yet no man must argue , that what they write is true , because they writ it ; but \u2018 tis evident , by the ridiculous mistakes and gross absurdities , which have been made by those poets who have taken their fancy only for their guide , that if this fancy be not regulated , it is a mere caprice , and utterly incapable to produce a reasonable and judicious poem . \u201d Footnote : 1 . The dictum of Rymer , concerning the royal prerogative in poetry , is thus expressed : \u201c We are to presume the highest virtues , where we find the highest of rewards ; and though it is not necessary that all heroes should be kings , yet , undoubtedly , all crowned heads , by poetical right , are heroes . This character is a flower ; a prerogative so certain , so inseparably annexed to the crown , as by no parliament of poets ever to be invaded . \u201d The Tragedies of the last Age considered , p. 61 . Dryden has elsewhere given his assent to this maxim , that a king , in poetry , as in our constitution , can do no wrong . The only apology for introducing a tyrant upon the stage , was to make him at the same time an usurper . PROLOGUE SPOKEN BY MR BETTERTON , REPRESENTING THE GHOST OF SHAKESPEARE . See , my loved Britons , see your Shakespeare rise , An awful ghost confessed to human eyes ! Unnamed , methinks , distinguished I had been From other shades , by this eternal green , About whose wreaths the vulgar poets strive , And with a touch , their withered bays revive . Untaught , unpractised , in a barbarous age , I found not , but created first the stage . And , if I drained no Greek or Latin store , \u2018 Twas , that my own abundance gave me more . On foreign trade I needed not rely , Like fruitful Britain , rich without supply . In this my rough-drawn play , you shall behold Some master-strokes , so manly and so bold , That he who meant to alter , found \u2018 em such , He shook , and thought it sacrilege to touch . Now , where are the successors to my name ? What bring they to fill out a poet 's fame ? Weak , short-lived issues of a feeble age ; Scarce living to be christened on the stage !

Dulness , that in a playhouse meets disgrace , Might meet with reverence , in its proper place . The fulsome clench , that nauseates the town , Would from a judge or alderman go down , Such virtue is there in a robe and gown ! And that insipid stuff which here you hate , Might somewhere else be called a grave debate ; Dulness is decent in the church and state . But I forget that still \u2018 tis understood , Bad plays are best decried by showing good .

Scowering the watch grows out-of-fashion wit : Now we set up for tilting in the pit , Where \u2018 tis agreed by bullies chicken-hearted , To fright the ladies first , and then be parted .

The choice of the play was THE SPANISH FRIAR , the only play forbid by the late K, Some unhappy expressions , among which those that follow , put her in some disorder , and forced her to hold up her fan , and often look behind her , and call for her palatine and hood , and any thing she could next think of ; while those who were in the pit before her , turned their heads over their shoulders , and all in general directed their looks towards her , whenever their fancy led them to make any application of what was said . In one place , where the queen of Arragon is going to church in procession , \u2018 tis said by a spectator , \u2018 Very good ; she usurps the throne , keeps the old king in prison , and , at the same time , is praying for a blessing on her army ; \u2019 \u2014 And when said , \u2018 That \u2018 tis observed at Court , who weeps , and who wears black for good king Sancho 's death , \u2019 \u2018 tis said , \u2018 Who is that , that can flatter a Court like this ? Can I sooth tyranny ? seem pleas 'd to see my Royal Master murthered ; his crown usurped ; a distaff in the throne ? \u2019 \u2014 And \u2018 What title has this queen , but lawless force ; and force must pull her down \u2019 \u2014 Twenty more things are said , which may be wrested to what they were never designed : but however , the observations then made furnished the town with talk , till something else happened , which gave it much occasion for discourse ; for another play being ordered to be acted , the queen came not , being taken up with other diversion . She dined with Mrs Gradens , the famous woman in the hall , that sells fine laces and head-dresses ; from thence she went to the Jew 's , that sells Indian things ; to Mrs Ferguson 's , De Vett 's , Mrs Harrison 's , and other Indian houses ; but not to Mrs Potter 's , though in her way ; which caused Mrs Potter to say , that she might as well have hoped for that honour as others , considering that the whole design of bringing the queen and king was managed at her house , and the consultations held there ; so that she might as well have thrown away a little money in raffling there , as well as at the other houses : but it seems that my lord Devonshire has got Mrs Potter to be laundress : she has not much countenance of the queen , her daughter still keeping the Indian house her mother had . The same day the queen went to one Mrs Wise 's , a famous woman for telling fortunes , but could not prevail with her to tell anything ; though to others she has been very true , and has foretold that king James shall came in again , and the duke of Norfolk shall lose his head : the last , I suppose , will naturally be the consequence of the first . These things , however innocent , have passed the censure of the town : and , besides a private reprimand given , the king gave one in public ; saying to the queen , that he heard she dined at a bawdy-house , and desired the next time she went , he might go . She said , she had done nothing but what the late queen had done . He asked her , if she meant to make her , her example . More was said on this occasion than ever was known before ; but it was borne with all the submission of a good wife , who leaves all to the direction of the k \u2014\u2014, and diverts herself with walking six or seven miles a-day , and looking after her buildings , making of fringes , and such like innocent things ; and does not meddle in government , though she has better title to do it than the late queen had . \u201d TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOHN , LORD HAUGHTONMY LORD , When I first designed this play , I found , or thought I found , somewhat so moving in the serious part of it , and so pleasant in the comic , as might deserve a more than ordinary care in both ; accordingly , I used the best of my endeavour , in the management of two plots , so very different from each other , that it was not perhaps the talent of every writer to have made them of a piece . Neither have I attempted other plays of the same nature , in my opinion , with the same judgment , though with like success . And though many poets may suspect themselves for the fondness and partiality of parents to their youngest children , yet I hope I may stand exempted from this rule , because I know myself too well to be ever satisfied with my own conceptions , which have seldom reached to those ideas that I had within me ; and consequently , I may presume to have liberty to judge when I write more or less pardonably , as an ordinary marksman may know certainly when he shoots less wide at what he aims . Besides , the care and pains I have bestowed on this , beyond my other tragi-comedies , may reasonably make the world conclude , that either I can do nothing tolerably , or that this poem is not much amiss . Few good pictures have been finished at one sitting ; neither can a true just play , which is to bear the test of ages , be produced at a heat , or by the force of fancy , without the maturity of judgment . For my own part , I have both so just a diffidence of myself , and so great a reverence for my audience , that I dare venture nothing without a strict examination ; and am as much ashamed to put a loose indigested play upon the public , as I should be to offer brass money in a payment ; for though it should be taken ,yet it would be found in the second telling ; and a judicious reader will discover , in his closet , that trashy stuff , whose glittering deceived him in the action . I have often heard the stationer sighing in his shop , and wishing for those hands to take off his melancholy bargain , which clapped its performance on the stage . In a playhouse , every thing contributes to impose upon the judgment ; the lights , the scenes , the habits , and , above all , the grace of action , which is commonly the best where there is the most need of it , surprise the audience , and cast a mist upon their understandings ; not unlike the cunning of a juggler , who is always staring us in the face , and over-whelming us with gibberish , only that he may gain the opportunity of making the cleaner conveyance of his trick . But these false beauties of the stage are no more lasting than a rainbow ; when the actor ceases to shine upon them , when he gilds them no longer with his reflection , they vanish in a twinkling . I have sometimes wondered , in the reading , what was become of those glaring colours which amazed me in \u201c Bussy D'Amboys \u201d upon the theatre ; but when I had taken up what I supposed a fallen star , I found I had been cozened with a jelly; nothing but a cold , dull mass , which glittered no longer than it was shooting ; a dwarfish thought , dressed up in gigantic words , repetition in abundance , looseness of expression , and gross hyperboles ; the sense of one line expanded prodigiously into ten ; and , to sum up all , uncorrect English , and a hideous mingle of false poetry , and true nonsense ; or , at best , a scantling of wit , which lay gasping for life , and groaning beneath a heap of rubbish . A famous modern poet used to sacrifice every year a Statius to Virgil 's manes; and I have indignation enough to burn a D'AMBOIS annually , to the memory of JonsonBut now , my lord , I am sensible , perhaps too late , that I have gone too far : for , I remember some verses of my own Maximin and Almanzor , which cry vengeance upon me for their extravagance , and which I wish heartily in the same fire with Statius and Chapman . All I can say for those passages , which are , I hope , not many , is , that I knew they were bad enough to please , even when I wrote them ; but I repent of them amongst my sins ; and , if any of their fellows intrude by chance into my present writings , I draw a stroke over all those Dalilah 's of the theatre ; and am resolved I will settle myself no reputation by the applause of fools . It is not that I am mortified to all ambition , but I scorn as much to take it from half-witted judges , as I should to raise an estate by cheating of bubbles . Neither do I discommend the lofty style in tragedy , which is naturally pompous and magnificent ; but nothing is truly sublime , that is not just and proper . If the antients had judged by the same measure , which a common reader takes , they had concluded Statius to have written higher than Virgil , for , Qu\u00e6 super-imposito moles geminata Colosso carries a more thundering kind of sound , than Tityre , tu patul\u00e6 recubans sub tegmine fagi : yet Virgil had all the majesty of a lawful prince , and Statius only the blustering of a tyrant . But when men affect a virtue which they cannot easily reach , they fall into a vice , which bears the nearest resemblance to it . Thus , an injudicious poet , who aims at loftiness , runs easily into the swelling puffy style , because it looks like greatness . I remember , when I was a boy , I thought inimitable Spencer a mean poet , in comparison of Sylvester 's \u201c Dubartas , \u201d and was wrapt into an ecstasy when I read these lines : Now , when the winter 's keener breath began To crystalize the Baltic ocean ; To glaze the lakes , to bridle up the floods , And periwig with snow the bald-pate woods :\u2014I am much deceived if this be not abominable fustian , that is , thoughts and words ill-sorted , and without the least relation to each other ; yet I dare not answer for an audience , that they would not clap it on the stage : so little value there is to be given to the common cry , that nothing but madness can please madmen , and the poet must be of a piece with the spectators , to gain a reputation with them . But , as in a room , contrived for state , the height of the roof should bear a proportion to the area ; so , in the heightenings of poetry , the strength and vehemence of figures should be suited to the occasion , the subject , and the persons . All beyond this is monstrous : it is out of nature , it is an excrescence , and not a living part of poetry . I had not said thus much , if some young gallants , who pretend to criticism , had not told me , that this tragi-comedy wanted the dignity of style ; but , as a man , who is charged with a crime of which he thinks himself innocent , is apt to be too eager in his own defence ; so , perhaps , I have vindicated my play with more partiality than I ought , or than such a trifle can deserve . Yet , whatever beauties it may want , it is free at least from the grossness of those faults I mentioned : what credit it has gained upon the stage , I value no farther than in reference to my profit , and the satisfaction I had , in seeing it represented with all the justness and gracefulness of action . But , as it is my interest to please my audience , so it is my ambition to be read : that I am sure is the more lasting and the nobler design : for the propriety of thoughts and words , which are the hidden beauties of a play , are but confusedly judged in the vehemence of action : all things are there beheld , as in a hasty motion , where the objects only glide before the eye , and disappear . The most discerning critic can judge no more of these silent graces in the action , than he who rides post through an unknown country can distinguish the situation of places , and the nature of the soil . The purity of phrase , the clearness of conception and expression , the boldness maintained to majesty , the significancy and sound of words , not strained into bombast , but justly elevated ; in short , those very words and thoughts , which cannot be changed , but for the worse , must of necessity escape our transient view upon the theatre ; and yet , without all these , a play may take . For , if either the story move us , or the actor help the lameness of it with his performance , or now and then a glittering beam of wit or passion strike through the obscurity of the poem , any of these are sufficient to effect a present liking , but not to fix a lasting admiration ; for nothing but truth can long continue ; and time is the surest judge of truth . I am not vain enough to think that I have left no faults in this , which that touchstone will not discover ; neither , indeed , is it possible to avoid them in a play of this nature . There are evidently two actions in it ; but it will be clear to any judicious man , that with half the pains I could have raised a play from either of them ; for this time I satisfied my humour , which was to tack two plays together ; and to break a rule for the pleasure of variety . The truth is , the audience are grown weary of continued melancholy scenes ; and I dare venture to prophecy , that few tragedies , except those in verse , shall succeed in this age , if they are not lightened with a course of mirth ; for the feast is too dull and solemn without the fiddles . But how difficult a task this is , will soon be tried ; for a several genius is required to either way ; and , without both of them , a man , in my opinion , is but half a poet for the stage . Neither is it so trivial an undertaking , to make a tragedy end happily ; for it is more difficult to save , than it is to kill . The dagger and the cup of poison are always in a readiness ; but to bring the action to the last extremity , and then by probable means to recover all , will require the art and judgement of a writer ; and cost him many a pang in the performance . And now , my lord , I must confess , that what I have written , looks more like a Preface , than a Dedication ; and , truly , it was thus far my design , that I might entertain you with somewhat in my own art , which might be more worthy of a noble mind , than the stale exploded trick of fulsome panegyrics . It is difficult to write justly on any thing , but almost impossible in praise . I shall therefore wave so nice a subject ; and only tell you , that , in recommending a protestant play to a protestant patron , as I do myself an honour , so I do your noble family a right , who have been always eminent in the support and favour of our religion and liberties . And if the promises of your youth , your education at home , and your experience abroad , deceive me not , the principles you have embraced are such , as will no way degenerate from your ancestors , but refresh their memory in the minds of all true Englishmen , and renew their lustre in your person ; which , my lord , is not more the wish , than it is the constant expectation , of Your lordship 's Most obedient , faithful servant , JOHN DRYDEN .
