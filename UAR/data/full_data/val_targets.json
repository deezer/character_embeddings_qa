In 1592 Chettle printed his tract called \u201c Kindhart 's Dream . \u201d Dilke observes : \u201c I am inclined to think , however , that kind-heart was the \u2018 travelling name \u2019 of some notorious quack tooth-drawer , or a cant name given to the whole race of them . So the stage-keeper , in the induction to \u2018 Bartholomew Fair , \u2019 when expressing his fear of the author 's success , says : \u2018 He has ne'er a sword-and-buckler man in his fair , nor a little Davy , to take toll of the bawds there , as in my time ; nor a kind-heart , if anybody 's teeth should chance to ake in his play . \u2019 And further , it is part of the \u2018 covenant and agreement , \u2019 in the same induction , that the audience shall not \u2018 look back to the sword-and-buckler age of Smithfield , but content themselves with the present . Instead of a little Davy , to take toll of the bawds , the author doth promise a strutting horse-courser , with a leer drunkard , two or three to attend him in as good equipage as you would wish . And then for kind-heart the tooth-drawer , a fine oily pig-woman , with , \u2019 \u201d & c ., & c .The artemisia or southern wood is meant .Jane has been too successful in her play on the names and qualities of the flowers to have chosen this at random ; and I am inclined to think the following extract from the \u201c Winter 's Tale \u201d will serve to elucidate her meaning \u2014 \u201c The fairest flowers o \u2019 the season Are our carnations and streak 'd gilliflowers .

Cramp-rings were formerly worn as charms for curing of the cramp . See Brookes 's \u201c Natural History , \u201d vol . i. p . 206 .\u2014 Pegge . Andrew Borde , in his \u201c Book of the Introduction of Knowledge , \u201d 1542 , says : \u201c The kynges of Englande ... doth halowe every yere crampe rynges , the which rynges worne on ones fynger doth helpe them the whyche hath the crampe . \u201d Dr Percy , in his notes on the \u201c Northumberland Household Book , \u201d speaking of these rings observes \u201c that our ancient kings even in those dark times of superstition , do not seem to have affected to cure the king 's evil ; at least in the MSS . above quoted there is no mention or hint of any power of that sort . This miraculous gift was left to be claimed by the Stuarts : our ancient Plantagenets were humbly content to cure the cramp . \u201d I cite this passage merely to remark that the learned editor of the above curious volume has been betrayed into a mistake by the manner in which the cramp rings are mentioned in Mr Anstis 's MSS . The power of curing the king 's evil was certainly claimed by many of the Plantagenets . The above Dr Borde , who wrote in the time of Henry VIII ., says , \u201c The kynges of England , by the power that God hath given to them , doth make sicke men whole of a sickness called the Kynges Evyll . \u201d In Laneham 's \u201c Account of the Entertainment of Kennilworth Castle , \u201d it is said , \u201c And also by her highness accustomed mercy and charitee , nyne cured of the paynful and dangerous diseaz called the King 's Evil , for that kings and queens of this realm withoout oother medsinonly doo cure it . \u201d Polydore Virgil asserts the same , and William Tooker , in the reign of Queen Elizabeth ,published a book on this subject .

Every one has heard of the collectanea and analecta poetarum .\u2014 Steevens .Robert Wisdom , a translator of the Psalms . Woodsays he was \u201c a good Latin and English poet of his time , and one that had been in exile in Queen Mary 's reign . He was also rector of Settrington in Yorkshire , and died in 1568 , having been nominated to a bishopric in Ireland in the time of Edward the 6th . \u201d His version of the Psalms is ridiculed in the \u201c Remains of Samuel Butler , \u201d 1759 , p. 41 \u2014 \u201c Thence , with short meal and tedious grace , In a loud tone and public place , Sings Wisdom 's Hymns , that trot and pace As if Goliah scann 'd \u2018 em . \u201d Again , p. 230 : \u201c Besides , when Rouse stood forth for his trial , Robin Wisdom was found the better poet . \u201dThe Author observes , in the opening of the tract : \u201c At fifteen years of age , her father being dead , her mother bestowed her in marriage upon one Master Philip Stubbes , with whom she lived four years and almost a half , very honestly and godly . \u201d Richard Brome , in his play of \u201c The Antipodes , \u201d act iii . sc . 2 , mentions one of them in the following manner \u2014 \u201c A booke of the godly life and death Of Mistress Katherine Stubs , which I have turn 'd Into sweet meetre , for the vertuous youth , To woe an ancient lady widow with . \u201d Again , Bishop Corbet in his \u201c Iter Boreale , \u201d says \u2014 \u201c And in some barn hear cited many an author , Kate Stubbs , Anne Ascue , or the Ladies Daughter . \u201di. e ., Been the mediator .

For the regulations of Mooting and Reading-Days , see Dugdale 's \u201c Origines Juridiciales . \u201dThis was Dr Matthew Sutcliff , Dean of Exeter , in the reign of King James I .; a person who had been one of the opponents of Parsons the Jesuit , in defence of the Reformed Religion . In the year 1616 he procured an Act of Parliament for incorporating himself and other divines to be provost and fellows of a college then founded at Chelsea , for promoting the study of polemic divinity , and vindicating the doctrines of the Reformation against all Popish writers . To carry this design into execution , he settled on the college four farms in Devonshire , of the value of L300 per annum , and the benefit of an extent on a statute , acknowledged by Sir Lewis Stukely , for L4000 . By the Act of Parliament , the college was empowered to bring a stream of water from the river Lee for the use of the city of London a scheme similar to that then lately executed by Sir Hugh Middleton . This foundation , although patronised both by King James and his sons , Prince Henry and Charles I ., yet fell to decay . One range of building only , scarce an eighth of the intended edifice , was erected by Dr Sutcliff , at the expense of L3000 . After lingering some time , suits were commenced about the title to the very ground on which the college stood , and by a decree of the Court of Chancery , in the time of Lord Coventry , three of the four farms were returned to Dr Sutcliff 's heir . See \u201c The Glory of Chelsey Colledge Revived , \u201d by John Darly , 4o , 1662 . Sutcliff 's wit seems almost to have been proverbial .

FOOTNOTES :i. e ., Prize\u2014 Collier .March-pane was a confection made of pistachio nuts , almonds , sugar , & c ., formerly in high esteem , and a constant article in the deserts of our ancestors . See the notes of Dr Gray , Mr Hawkins , and Mr Steevens , to \u201c Romeo and Juliet , \u201d act i. sc . 5 .This is called a St Stephen 's pudding : it used formerly to be provided at St John 's College , Cambridge , uniformly on St Stephen 's day .\u2014 Pegge .SeeOr , caveare . Giles Fletcher , in his \u201c Russe Commonwealth , \u201d 1591 , p. 11 , says : \u201c In Russia they have divers kinds of fish , very good and delicate : as the Bellouga or Bellougina , of four or five elnes long ; the Ostrina or Sturgeon , but not so thicke nor long . These four kinds of fish breed in the Volgha , and are catched in great plenty , and served thence into the whole realme for a great food . Of the roes of these foure kinds , they make very great store of Icary , or caveary . \u201d The introduction of these foreign delicacies is ridiculed by several writers of the times ; as Ben Jonson 's \u201c Cynthia 's Revels , \u201d act iii . sc . 1 : \u201c Come ; let us go and taste some light dinner , a dish of sliced caviare , or so . \u201d And in Marston 's \u201c What you Will , \u201d act ii . sc . 1 \u2014 \u201c A man can scarce put on a tuckt-up cap , A button 'd frizado sute ; scarce eate good meate , Anchovies , caviare , but hee 's satired , And term 'd phantasticall . \u201dThe malacoton is one of the late peaches . So in Ben Jonson 's \u201c Bartholomew Fair \u201d \u2014 \u201c A soft velvet head like a mellicotton . \u201d \u2014 Steevens .Olived is a term of cookery . In Murrell 's \u201c New Book of Cookery , \u201dis a receipt to make an olive-pie to be eaten hot . Olives are collops of any meat .\u2014 Steevens .Cartwright has fetched most of his antiquated terms from Chaucer . I have therefore given the explanation of them from Mr Tyrwhitt 's excellent glossary on that author .Snub , reprove .\u2014 T .Think , suppose .\u2014 T .A prater .\u2014 T .Fr .

With an Eligie on the death of the most Noble Lady , the Lady Venetia Digby . London , Printed by N. and I. Okes for Iohn Benson .... 1635 . 8o .A piece bearing the same title as Rutter 's was written by Sir W. Denny at a later date , and is printed from the original MS. in \u201c Inedited Poetical Miscellanies , \u201d 1870 . It seems to be a hypothesis sufficiently plausible to justify a passing notice , in that one of the suppressed printed at the end of the \u201c Private Memoirs of Sir Kinelm Digby , \u201d 1827 , the intimacy of Digby with a royal personage is described in very warm terms and colours , and that Rutter , who was in Digby 's family at one time , may have founded on what came to his ears the episode of Sylvia and Thyrsis in this production . ]This author wrote in the reign of Charles the First . He lived with the Earl of Dorset , as tutor to his son , and translated , at the desire of his patron , the Cid of Corneille , a tragi-comedy , in two partsIt appears , from his dedication of this pastoral to Sir Kenelm Digby , that he lived also with that gentleman for some time , but in what capacity I cannot tell . The plainness and simplicity of this pastoral is commended by Thomas May , author of \u201c The Heir \u201d and \u201c The Old Couple ; \u201d and also by Ben Jonson in the following lines \u2014 \u201c I have read And weigh 'd your play ; untwisted every thread , And know the woof and warp thereof ; can tell Where it runs round and even ; where so well , So soft , and smooth it handles , the whole piece , As it were , spun by nature off the fleece . \u201d DRAMATIS PERSONAE .

To this fair company I am to say , You 're welcome all to a well-meaning play ; For such our author made it , with intent To defame none . His muse is innocent : A virgin yet , that has not found the ways Out of foul crimes to raise herself a praise ; And therefore she desires you would excuse All bitter strains , that suit a satire muse : And that which so much takes the vulgar ear \u2014 Looseness of speech , which they for jests do hear . She hopes none such are here , therefore she dares Venture this story , purg 'd from lighter airs : A piece entire , without or patch or maim , Round in itself , and everywhere the same . And if there be not i n't what they call wit , There might have been , had it been thought so fit . A shepherd 's muse gently of love does sing , And with it mingles no impurer thing . Such she presents unto your ears and eyes , And yet your Christian freedom not denies Of liking or disliking what you will : You may say this is well , or that is ill , Without dispute ; for why should you that pay For what you have , be taught what you should say ? Or made to judge by any square or rule , As if you came not to a stage , but school ? No , he that made it says , if you will eat , He will not force your stomachs : there 's your meat ; Which if you like , \u2018 tis well ; if not , all 's one ; There must be difference in opinion . Besides , he 's sure , whatever he could wish , Your taste , and not his art , must praise the dish . The Shepherds \u2019 Holiday .", "Come , sit down , my jovial boys , and roar .

If the tailor 's countenance were in fashion now , and all that had fiery faces were counted comets , what a decay would there be amongst our houses of good fellowship . How our cans would rot and jugs grow musty for want of use ! I would the whole city were jugs and cans , that they might never be in good case but when they 're full of good liquor . I fear this will be a bad year for all of our profession ; salt meats are grown out of fashion , and Lent will be forgotten this year , and , for aught I know , the next Papist that 's drunk may make the people condemn it for superstition because he uses it . Forbid , thou who ever art patron of good fellowship !", "Come , set about , set about , my boon companions .", "We 'll drink ourselves into fish , and eat ourselves into cormorants ; we 'll not fast , though it be an eve to a surfeiting gawdy day .", "There \u2018 tis ; go , be nimble .We have had but small takings to-day ; men have got the squincy or stopping of the throat , I think \u2014 they drink so slowly .

The sleights of nicking and frothing he scorns as too common , but supplies that defect with little jugs and great glasses , and where he fears a dissolution , brings up his flagon , begins the king 's health , and with that decoy draws on another dozen or two , till the whole royal progeny is gone over . He wished it once as numerous as old Priam 's was , and another time had like to have been hanged for praying treason , that there were a hundred kings i \u2019 th \u2019 land , that men might be forced to drink all their healths for fear of displeasing any .

COURTIERS SONG OF THE CITIZEN . Poore Citizen , if thou wilt be A happy husband , learne of me ; To set thy wife first in thy shop , A faire wife , a kinde wife , a sweet wife , sets a poore man vp . What though thy shelues be ne 're so bare : 5 A woman still is currant ware : Each man will cheapen , foe , and friend , But whilst thou art at tother end , What ere thou seest , or what dost heare , Foole , haue no eye to , nor an eare ; 10 And after supper for her sake , When thou hast fed , snort , though thou wake : What though the Gallants call thee mome ? Yet with thy lanthorne light her home : Then looke into the town and tell , 15 If no such Tradesmen there doe dwell . NOTESCharalois \u2014 the name Charalois is a corruption of Charolais , the Count of Charolais being the hereditary title of the heir-apparent of the Duchy of Burgundy , for whom the county of Charolais , an arriere-fief of Burgundy , was reserved as an appanage . This domain had been purchased by Philip the Bold for his son , John the Fearless . I , i , 4. argue me of \u2014 obsolete construction : \u201c accuse me of . \u201d Cf . Ray , Disc .

Your sable habit , with the hat and cloak ... haue power \u2014 the details of hat , cloak , and ribbons , interposed between subject and verb , have attracted the latter into the plural , to the violation of its agreement with its substantive . I , i , 70. in that \u2014 i. e ., in the fact that justice had no such guards . I , i , 73-7 . For the allusion to Cerberus and the sops , cf . Virgil 's picture of Aeneas \u2019 journey to Hades\u201c Huge Cerberus makes these realms to resound with barking from his tripple jaws , stretched at his enormous length in a den that fronts the gate . To whom the prophetess , seeing his neck now bristle with horrid snakes , flings a soporific cake of honey and medicated grain . He , in the mad rage of hunger , opening his three mouths , snatches the offered morsel , and , spread on the ground , relaxes his monstrous limbs , and is extended at vast length over all the cave . Aeneas , now that the keeperis buried, seizes the passage and swift overpasses the bank of that flood whence there is no return . \u201d \u2014 Davidson 's trans . I , i , 75. fertyle headed \u2014 many headed , fertyle is used in the now obsolete sense of abundant . I , i , 92. such , whose \u2014 for the construction , cf .

I , i , 99. men religious \u2014 the adjective is regularly placed after its noun in Eliz . Eng . when the substantive is unemphatic and the modifier not a mere epithet , but essential to the sense . See Abbott , S. G. Sec . 419 . I , i , 137-8 .\u2014 The thought of these lines is undeveloped , the phrasing being broken and disconnected . It is a scornful observation on the part of Romont that whether or not Novall takes papers depends on how the matter is brought before him \u2014 and he is about to add that there is a way in which Charalois can manage to gain his point , when he breaks off with the cry , \u201c Follow him ! \u201d Conuayance = contrivance . I , i , 164. parchment toils \u2014 snares in the shape of documents upon parchment , such as bonds , mortgages , etc . I , i , 166 . Luxury \u2014 used here in the modern sense ,\u2014 not , as more commonly in Elizabethan times , with the meaning , laciviousness , lust . The thought of the somewhat involved period which ends with this line is , that the creditors prayed only on an occasion when they feared to lose their clutch on some rich spendthrift \u2014 on which occasion they would pray to the devil to invent some new and fantastic pleasure which would lure their victim back into the toils . I , ii , 11 . Dijon \u2014 the scene of the drama ,\u2014 situated on the western border of the fertile plain of Burgundy , and at the confluence of the Ouche and the Suzon . It was formerly the capital of the province of Burgundy , the dukes of which acquired it early in the eleventh century , and took up their residence there in the thirteenth century . For the decoration of the palace and other monuments built by them , eminent artists were gathered from northern France and Flanders , and during this period the town became one of the great intellectual centers of France . The union of the duchy with the crown in 1477 deprived Dijon of the splendor of the ducal court , but to counterbalance this loss it was made the capital of the province and the seat of a parlement . To-day it possesses a population of some 65 , 000 , and is a place of considerable importance . I , ii , 21-3 .

The figure here seems to be somewhat confused , as the dead hero is the son of the country , his mother , who devours him . The thought , perhaps , in the mind of the dramatist , albeit ill-expressed , was that the mother-country owed her existence to her son , and , viper-like had devoured the author of her life . II , i , 66. eate \u2014 owing to the tendency to drop the inflectional ending - en , the Elizabethans frequently used the curtailed forms of past participles , which are common in Early English : \u201c I have spoke , forgot , writ , chid , \u201d etc .\u2014 Abbott , S.

II , i , 93-4 . Would they not so , etc .\u2014 the Q. reading is to be preferred to either of the modern emendations . It is probably in the sense of \u201c Would they no more but so ? \u201d , with the ensuing declaration that in that case they would keep their tears to stopbottlesII , i , 98-9 . Y'are ne 're content , Crying nor laughing \u2014 The meaning is , of course : \u201c You are never content with us , whether we are crying or laughing . \u201d II , i , 100 . Both with a birth \u2014 i. e ., both together , at the same time . II , i , 137 . Burmudas \u2014 The Bermuda islands , known only through the tales of early navigators who suffered shipwreck there , enjoyed a most unsavory reputation in Elizabethan times , as being the seat of continual tempests , and the surrounding waters \u201c a hellish sea for thunder , lightning , and storms . \u201d Cf . Shakespeare , The Tempest , I , ii , 269 : \u201c the still-vexed Bermoothes . \u201d They were said to be enchanted , and inhabited by witches and devils . They were made famous by the shipwreck there in 1609 of Sir George Somers ; the following year one of his party , Sil . Jordan , published A Discovery of the Bermudas , otherwise called the Isle of Devils . Field has another reference to \u201c the Barmuthoes \u201d in Amends for Ladies , III , iv ; but there it is not clear whether he means the islands or certain narrow passages north of Covent Garden , which went by the slang name of \u201c the Bermudas \u201d or \u201c the Streights . \u201d It is in this latter sense that the word is used in Jonson 's The Devil is an Ass , II , i . II , i , 139 . Exact the strictnesse \u2014 i. e ., require a strict enforcement of the sentence which limits Charalois to the confines of the prison . II , i , 144. vsurers relief , etc .\u2014 a rather awkward expression , so phrased for the sake of the end-scene rhyme . The thought seems to be : \u201c The relief which usurers have to offer mourns , if the debtors havetoo much grief . \u201d Charalois \u2019 remark is , of course , ironical . II , ii , 10. electuary \u2014 a medicinal conserve or paste , consisting of a powder or some other ingredient mixed with honey , preserve , or syrup of some other kind . Beaumelle means that Florimal is the medicine and Bellapert the sweet which makes it palatable . II , ii , 17. serue \u2014 G. and S. read served , which is certainly correct . Not only is there nothing throughout the play to suggest that Beaumelle 's mother is still alive , but she herself has just spoken of \u201c you two my women \u201dII , ii , 18. a peepe out \u2014 a \u201c pip \u201dis one of the spots on playing cards , dice , or dominoes . The allusion is to a game of cards called \u201c one-and-thirty \u201d ; thirty-two is a pip too many . II , ii , 21-2. the mother of the maydes \u2014 a title properly applied to the head of the maids of honour in a Royal household . II , ii , 22. mortifie \u2014 there is a significant ambiguity to the word Bellapert uses . It means \u201c bring into subjection , \u201d \u201c render dead to the world and the flesh ; \u201d it formerly had also a baleful meaning : \u201c to kill ; \u201d \u201c to destroy the vitality , vigor , or activity of . \u201d II , ii , 32. vanuable , to make you thus \u2014 valuable is used in its generic sense of value-able , of sufficient value . II , ii , 71. turn 'd in her varieties \u2014 G ., S. read : trimm 'd in her varieties \u2014 i. e ., \u201c decked in her varieties\" But adherence to the Q. is possible , with the meaning , \u201c fashioned in her varieties . \u201d II , ii , 82. walkes not vnder a weede \u2014 i. e ., \u201c wears not a garment , \u201d \u201c is not in existence . \u201d II , ii , 88 . Tissue \u2014 a rich kind of cloth , often interwoven with gold or silver . So again in II , ii , 175 . II , ii , 89. a three-leg 'd lord \u2014 the meaning is that Young Novall cannot independently \u201c stand upon his own legs , \u201d but requires the triple support of himself , Liladam , and Aymer . II , ii , 96. musicke house \u2014 a public hall or saloon for musical performances . II , ii , 99-100. in the Galley foyst , etc .\u2014 a Galley-foist was a state barge , especially that of the Lord Mayor of London . This , however , can hardly be the meaning of the word here , used as it is in connection with Bullion , which were trunk-hose , puffed out at the upper part , in several folds ; and with Quirpo , a variant of cuerpo \u2014 i. e ., in undress . \u201c Galley-foist \u201d may be the name of some dress of the period , so-called for its resemblance to the gaily bedecked Mayor'shYpppHeNbarge . But it is not unlikely , as Mason suggests , that The Galley-foist and The Bullion were the names of taverns of that day ; or else of houses of public resort for some kind of amusement . II , ii , 104. skip \u2014 so in all texts . But Field has elsewhere\u201c and then my lord ... casts a suit every quarter , which I slip into . \u201d It is probable that the word was the same in both passages ,\u2014 though whether skip or slip I have no means of determining . II , ii , 119 . St Omers \u2014 more properly , St. Omer , a town of northern France . A College of Jesuits was located there , and the point of Novall 's comparison is perhaps an allusion to the mean appearance of Jesuit spies who would come from thence to England on some pretext , such as to see their friends during the Christmas season . II , ii , 122. ly'n perdieu \u2014 \u201c to lie perdu \u201d is properly a military term for , \u201c to be placed as a sentinel or outpost , \u201d especially in an exposed position . Ly'n is one of the many obsolete forms of the past participle of the verb \u201c to lie . \u201d II , ii , 125. tye my hand \u2014 i. e ., tie the ribbon-strings which depended from the sleeve over the hand . II , ii , 163. slight neglect \u2014 contemptuous disrespect . II , ii , 174. bile \u2014 all editors after the Q. read boil . Bile was an old spelling for boil ; but in the other sense , one of the \u201c four humours \u201d of medieval physiology , the passage is perfectly clear , and the figure perhaps even more effective . II , ii , 186. eager relish \u2014 acrid taste . The figure is that the law in itself is often like a sharp and bitter flavor , but that a good judge will sweeten this . II , ii , 250 s. d. Drawes a Curtayne \u2014 the curtain of the alcove or back-stage , within which was placed the \u201c treasure , \u201d thus to be revealed . II , ii , 298. in which yours \u2014 i. e ., \u201c because of the fact of her being yours . \u201d II , ii , 301. for poore and worthlesse I \u2014 I for me , like other irregularities in pronominal inflection , was not infrequent in Elizabethan times . Cf . Abbott , S. G ., Sec . 205 . II , ii , 326 . Curtius-like \u2014 like Marcus Curtius , legendary hero of ancient Rome . See Livy , vii , 6 . II , ii , final s. d. while the Act is playing \u2014 i. e ., while the interlude music is played , at the close of the Act . III , i , 18. relish \u2014 a trace or tinge of some quality , a suggestion .\u2014 In III , i , 20 : a flavor ; or , if read with the Q . ' s punctuation , a verb : give a relish . It appears preferable , however , to take the passage as punctuated by G ., S ., which makes relish a noun . III , i , 29. take me with you \u2014 understand me . III , i , 37. sudden \u2014 adv . for suddenly . The - ly suffix was frequently omitted in Elizabethan times . III , i , 45 . Such as are faire , etc .\u2014 the connection goes back to l. 42 , Bellapert taking up again the thread of her remark which Novall 's objection and her summary answer thereto had broken in upon . III , i , 120 . Christian \u2014 probably used here in the colloq . sense of : a human being , as distinguished from a brute ; a \u201c decent \u201d or \u201c respectable \u201d person . Cf . Shakespeare , Twelfth Night , I , iii , 89 : \u201c Methinks ... I have no more wit than a Christian , or an ordinary man has . \u201d III , i , 122 . The entertaiment of your visitation \u2014 i. e ., the entertainment which your visit received . III , i , 123. on\u2014 i. e ., a visitation . III , i , 126 . Muske-cat \u2014 the civet-cat ; applied as a term of contempt to a fop , as being a person perfumed with musk . III , i , 139. there is now speaks to you \u2014 G ., S. omit is , at the same time clearing the construction and securing a more regular metre . The Q. reading , however , is perfectly possible , as an ellipsis , by omission of the subject relative , for , there is that now speaks to you, or even , by a change of punctuation , there is \u2014 now speaks to you \u2014, etc . III , i , 148 . As Caesar , did he liue , could not except at \u2014 see Plutarch 's Life of Julius Caesar , Chapters 9 & 10 , wherein it is narrated how Caesar divorced his wife , Pompeia , when scandal assailed her name , although he denied any knowledge as to her guilt ; \u201c \u2018 Because \u2019 said he , \u2018 I would have the chastity of my wife clear even of suspicion . \u2019 \u201d III , i , 148. except at \u2014 take exception at . III , i , 159. pointed \u2014 all editors after the Q. read painted , an absolutely unnecessary and unwarranted emendation . Pointed means \u201c fitted or furnished with tagged points or laces ; \u201d \u201c wearing points ; \u201d \u201c laced . \u201d Cf . Maurice Hewlett 's novel , The Queen 's Quair , p. 83 : \u201c saucy young men , trunked , puffed , pointed , trussed and doubleted . \u201d Huloet in his Dictionaryhas : \u201c Poynted , or tyed with poynts , ligulatus . \u201d III , i , 167 . This pretty rag \u2014 i. e ., the \u201c clout \u201d mentioned in II , ii , 123 . III , i , 173. in spite of \u2014 in scorn of , in defiance of . III , i , 184. thy \u2014 so the Q . All later editors read this . It is not impossible , of course , that Romont should begin an oath \u201c By thy hand , \u201d and Beaumelle flash back at him \u201c And sword , \u201d transferring the thy from herself to him . But Romont would be more likely to swear by his own hand than by Beaumelle 's . III , i , 188. cast suburb whores \u2014 prostitutes who had been cashiered from service . Houses of ill-fame were customarily located in the suburbs . III , i , 191. legion \u2014 i. e ., of evil spirits . Cf . Mark , v , 9 . III , i , 193. horne-mad \u2014 the word was originally applied to horned beasts , in the sense : \u201c enraged so as to horn any one ; \u201d hence of persons : \u201c stark mad , \u201d \u201c mad with rage , \u201d \u201c furious . \u201d By word-play it acquires its sense in the present passage . \u201c mad with rage at having been made a cuckold . \u201d III , i , 202. yellow \u2014 this color was regarded as a token or symbol of jealousy . III , i , 211 . Carted \u2014 carried in a cart through the streets , by way of punishment or public exposureIII , i , 261. in distance \u2014 within reach , in striking distance . III , i , 331. as it would tire \u2014 as appears to be used for as if ; in reality the if is implied in thesubjunctive .\u2014 Abbott , S. G ., Sec . 107 . III , i , 331. a beadle \u2014 it was one of the duties of a beadle to whip petty offenders . III , i , 352 . So I not heard them \u2014 Abbott explains this construction , not uncommon in the Elizabethan period , as an omission of the auxiliary verb \u201c do \u201dBut here the main verb is heard , whereas , according to his explanation , grammar would require hear . May not the construction be better taken as a simple , though to our ears cumbrous , inversion of , So I heard them not ? III , i , 366. cause \u2014 affair , business \u2014 so also in III , i , 377 . III , i , 388 . Calenture \u2014 a disease incident to sailors within the tropics ; a burning fever . III , i , 428-9. flegme ... choller \u2014 in the old physiologies the predominance of the \u201c humour , phlegm , \u201d was held to cause constitutional indolence or apathy ,\u2014 the predominance of \u201c choler \u201d to cause irascibility . III , i , 432 . \u2018 em \u2014 grammatical precision would require him , as is substituted in M ., f. In Field 's rapid , loose style , however , a change of construction in mid-sentence is not improbable , and the Q. reading may very well reproduce accurately what he wrote . III , i , 441. thou curious impertinent \u2014 the epithet is from The Curious Impertinent of Cervantes , a story imbedded in Don Quixote , Part I . III , i , 463 . I not accuse \u2014 cf . note on l. 354 . III , i , 467 . Ere liue \u2014 Ere I should live is required in full by strict grammar , but Field 's verse is frequently elliptical . Gifford 's emendation to lived for the sake of grammatical regularity , which is followed by all later editors , is unwarranted . III , i , 467. mens marginall fingers \u2014 the figure is an allusion to the ancient custom of placing an index hand in the margin of books , to direct the reader 's attention to a striking passage . So does Romont picture men 's fingers pointing to the story of Charalois as a noteworthy and lamentable thing . Cf . IV , i , 56 . III , i , 469-470 . An Emperour put away his wife for touching Another man .\u2014 The source of this allusion is not apparent . Can it be a perversion in the mind of Field of the story of Caesar 's divorce of his wife , to which Massinger has already referred above? IV , i , 3. a flaxe \u2014 the flax wick of a lamp or candle . IV , i , 3. a red headed womans chamber \u2014 Since early times red-haired individuals have been supposed to emit an emanation having a powerful sexually exciting influence .

He looks about him expectantly , and then sits down to wait . CULCHARDNo sign of him yet ! I do like a man to keep an appointment . If this is the way he begins \u2014 I have my doubts whether he is quite the sort of fellow to \u2014 but I took the precaution to ask Hugh Rose about him , and Rose said he was the best company in the world , and I could n't help getting on with him . I do n't think Rose would deceive me . And from all I 've seen of Podbury , he seems a pleasant fellow enough . What a Babel ! All these people bent on pleasure , going to seek it in as many directions \u2014 with what success no one can predict . There 's an idea for a sonnet there .AN AMURRCAN CITIZENSee here , I 've been around with your tickets in Yurrup , and when I was at Vernis , I bought some goods at a store there , and paid cash down for \u2018 em , and they promised to send \u2018 em on for me right here , and that was last fall , and I 've never heard any more of \u2018 em , and what I want you should do now is to instruct your representative at Vernis to go round and hev a talk with that man , and ask him what in thunder he means by it , and kinder hint that he 'll hev the Amurrcan Consul in his hair pretty smart , if he do n't look slippier !"]}, "act_index": 27, "play_index": 27}, {"data": {"693": ["Miss Trotter !

CULCHARD and PODBURY are seated side by side in the gondola , which is threading its way between low banks , bright with clumps of Michaelmas daisies and pomegranate-trees laden with red fruit . Both CULCHARD and PODBURY are secretly nervous and anxious for encouragement . PODBURYLa-doodle-um-La-doodle-oo : La-doodle-um-te-dumpty-loodle-oo ! I think she rather seemed to like me \u2014 those first days at Brussels , do n't you ? CULCHARDDid she ? I dare say .Few-fee ; di-fee-fee-few-few ; few-fiddledy-fee-fiddledy-few-few-few-fee . I fancy I 'm right in my theory , eh ?", "That is certainly my intention ; have you any objection to offer ?", "I \u2014 er \u2014 not at all ... most distressed , I assure you ... really no notion \u2014\u2014", "Oh , I \u2014 I was n't \u2014\u2014Er \u2014 I hope you have n't been inconvenienced at all ?", "Surely one may express a natural enthusiasm without laying oneself open \u2014\u2014?", "How thoroughly she understands me !", "Fortunately \u2014 yes . And \u2014 er \u2014 your engagement happily concluded ?", "It does n't seem to be making any particular impression on you , I must say !", "Hem \u2014 we are gazing upon one of the landmarks of our national history \u2014 Miss Trotter .", "How can I tell ?Podbury ! What did I tell you ? One 's just bitten me \u2014 the beast !I say , I can hear him buzzing all over the place !", "That ass Podbury ! To think of his taking me in with an idiotic trick like that ! And before Her too ! And when I had made it all right about the other evening , and was producing an excellent impression on the way up here . I wish I could hear what they are whispering about \u2014 more silly jokes at my expense , no doubt . Bah ! as if it affected me !", "Your feelings have apparently undergone a sudden change \u2014 quite recently !", "Nonsense , you 're well enough . And why you should feel low , with all your advantages \u2014 in Venice as you are , and in constant intercourse with a mind adorned with every feminine gift \u2014!", "I cannot say I recall it at this moment . Does he hold that a lover should expect to be accepted by \u2014 er \u2014 instalments , because , if so \u2014\u2014", "Ca n't say . Not had much of it , at present .", "Everything !\u2014 money , coupons , circular notes ! They \u2014 they must have fallen out going up that infernal Niederwald .You would insist on going !", "Talk to him yourself , my dear fellow , I 'm not going to make a row .", "The fascinating Miss Trotter is up above with Van Boodeler , so my services are not required .", "She must have understood every word we said ! Are you in earnest over this ?Well , you 'll soon get tired of your own society , I warn you .", "Think of it ! the actual spot on which Romeo and Juliet \u2014 Shakspeare 's Juliet \u2014 drew their last breath ! Does it not realise the tragedy for you ?", "So we have ! My friend is one , and he 'll be here presently , but I much prefer myself to see every seat occupied . There is something so depressing about a vacant chair , do n't you think ?", "Hum \u2014 well . She is \u2014 er \u2014 peculiar , do n't you know , and I rather doubt whether you will have much in common .", "Ah , well , I do n't grudge you your little joke if it amuses you . Those laugh best who laugh last . And it 's settled now that we 're going to Nuremberg .", "I rather gathered as much . I think I could guess the \u2014\u2014", "The other !\u2014 that 's Me ! I wish to goodness you would n't make all that noise , Podbury , just when it 's getting interesting !", "Organ-grinder ! you are so very insular ! For anything you can tell , he may be a decayed nobleman .", "I may return your charming candour by admitting that my \u2014 er \u2014 dismissal will be \u2014 well , not wholly without its consolations .", "I hope you \u2014 ah \u2014 undeceived her ?", "Can she be really as indifferent as she seems ? I 'm afraid she has very little heart ! But if only she can be induced to go back to Lugano .... She will be at the same hotel \u2014 a great point ! I wish that fellow Van Boodeler was n't coming too , though .... Not that they 've settled to come at all yet !... Still , I fancy she likes the idea .... She 'll come \u2014 if I do n't appear too anxious about it !CHAPTER XIV . + Miss Banquo .+ SCENE \u2014 Gardens belonging to the Hotel du Parc , Lugano . Time , afternoon ; the orchestra is turning up in a kiosk . CULCHARD is seated on a bench in the shade , keeping an anxious eye upon the opposite door .", "I am glad you see it in that light . Are n't you a little irritable to-night ?", "The fact is that I much prefer to receive my impressions of a scene like this in solitude .", "Feedy-feedy-feedle !", "Nothing ? How little she knows me !", "Did you hear , Podbury ? She 's actually pleading for me ! Is n't she an angel ? Be quiet , now . I must hear the answer !", "May I ask which knight you refer to ?", "As soon as you please . We might start for Constance to-morrow , if you like .", "I feel bound to state at once that , in my own case , my position at Somerset House would render anything of that sort utterly impracticable .", "Tunny ? Thank you . I \u2014 er \u2014 will certainly remember his name , if I require a guide .", "Will you kindly understand that I am quite capable of estimating the precise period of this sculpture for myself .", "I am . This gentleman gets off \u2014 is it Bacharach or Maintz ,", "About you ? I really do n't recollect that she mentioned you particularly .", "No doubt that course is open to her . But why seven , and where is he expected to go ?", "It 's fanciful , perhaps \u2014 but , if you do n't mind waiting a little , I should like to contribute \u2014 not my card , but a sonnet . I feel one on its way .", "Va bene , va bene \u2014 we know all about it !", "Ah , good morning ! What are your \u2014 er \u2014 impressions of Venice , Mr. Trotter ?", "We sha n't get over it for some hours yet .", "I should advise you not to be over-confident .They are here , you see \u2014 those are evidently their gondolas , I recognise those two cloaks . Now the best thing we can do is to separate .", "That 's impossible , and I can prove it . The service she demanded was , that I should leave Constance at once \u2014 with you . Do you understand \u2014 with you , Podbury !", "I suppose you intend to enlighten her as to my \u2014 er \u2014 little flirtationwith Miss Trotter ? Do it , Podbury , do it \u2014 if you think you 'll gain any good by it !", "She 's with Miss", "Because I thought we 'd see Bruges and Ghent on our way to", "Torcello \u2014 \u201c the Mother of Venice ! \u201d it really seems a pity to go away without having seen it . Do you know , Podbury , I think I 'll join you !", "As much as there is in not going farther than somewhere else , I should have thought .", "Did n't I ? Oh , surely ! yes , I 've \u2014 er \u2014 met that lady .You are an Art-Collector ? Indeed ? And \u2014 er \u2014 have you \u2014 er \u2014?", "On precisely similar luck . Miss Trotter and I \u2014 er \u2014 arrived at the conclusion last night that we were not formed to make each other 's happiness .", "Was he ? I dare say . But I rather understood we came out with the idea of keeping out of all that .", "I can get the coupons changed for Switzerland if you prefer it . The Swiss Lakes may be the more picturesque .", "Mr. Trotter is the only relation of yours I have had the pleasure of meeting , as yet .", "How on earth can I tell ? If it is so , you must be a philosopher , my dear fellow , and bear it \u2014 that 's all .", "For those who enjoy it . She has only been in there an hour , so she is not likely to come back just yet . What do you say to coming into S. S. Giovanni e Paulo again , with me ? Those tombs form a really remarkable illustration , as Ruskin points out , of the gradual decay of \u2014\u2014 MISS TROTTERJust hold these a spell till I come back . Thanks ever so much .... Well , Mr. Podbury ! Are n't you going to admire my purchases ? They 're real antique \u2014 or if they are n't , they 'll wear all the better .... There , I believe I 'll just have to run back a minute \u2014 do n't you put those things in the gondola yet , Mr. Culchard , or they 'll get stolen .", "Constance , and \u2014 er \u2014 until recently \u2014\u2014", "Podbury ?", "I did , my dear Podbury . But it never occurred to me that the fancy would take you to get tired of a place before you got there !", "If Podbury wo n't come down to breakfast at a decent hour , he can n't complain if I \u2014\u2014 I wonder if he heard Miss Trotter say she was thinking of coming here this morning . Somehow , I should like that girl to have a more correct comprehension of my character . I do n't so much mind her thinking me fastidious and exclusive . I dare say I am \u2014 but I do object to being made out a hopeless melancholiac !So these are Wiertz 's masterpieces , eh ? h 'm . Strenuous , vigorous ,\u2014 a trifle crude , perhaps . Did n't he refuse all offers for his pictures during his lifetime ? Hardly think he could have been overwhelmed with applications for the one opposite .Not a dining-room picture . Still , I like his independence \u2014 work up rather well in a sonnet . Let me see .\u201c He scorned to ply his sombre brush for hire . \u201d Now if I read that to Podbury , he 'd pretend to think I was treating of a shoe-black on strike ! Podbury is so utterly deficient in reverence .THE DAUGHTER\u201c I could not \u2018 elp fancying this was the artist 's por-portrait ?\u2014 portent ?\u2014 no , protest against des-des \u2014despoticism , and tyranny , but I see it is only \u2014 Por-Porliffymus fasting upon the companions of Ulyces . \u201d Her Male Parent .

I find him distasteful to me , and avoid him as much as I can , that 's all . I wish , Podbury , er \u2014 I almost wish you could have stayed with me , instead of allowing the Prendergasts to carry you off as they did . You would have kept Van Boodeler in order .", "You used to say she was n't what you call cultivated .", "Good Heavens , no \u2014 what a very grotesque idea of yours , my dear fellow !", "You 're perfectly welcome \u2014 when I 've had mine . I 'll \u2014 er \u2014 wish you good evening .CHAPTER XI . Courtship according to Mr. Ruskin . SCENE \u2014 A Balcony outside the Musik-Saal of the Insel Hotel , Constance . MISS PRENDERGAST is seated ; CULCHARD is leaning against the railing close by . It is about nine ; the moon has risen , big and yellow , behind the mountains at the further end of the Lake ; small black boats are shooting in and out of her track upon the water ; the beat of the steamers \u2019 paddles is heard as they come into harbour . CULCHARD has just proposed . MISS PRENDERGASTI have already felt very strongly with Ruskin , that no girl should have the cruelty to refuse a proposal \u2014\u2014", "If you expect me to travel for seven years with him , permit me to mention that I simply cannot do it . My leave expires in three weeks .", "No \u2014 I was merely feeling for my note-book . I had a sudden idea for a sonnet , that 's all .", "I must look up in another minute \u2014 and then ! CHAPTER XV . + Culchard comes out Nobly .+ SCENE \u2014 The Table d'Hote at Lugano ; CULCHARD has not yet caught MISS PRENDERGAST 'S eye . CULCHARDHave you \u2014 ah \u2014 been up Monte Generoso yet ?", "The little vixen ! Saw I was getting tired of it , and took care to strike first . Clever \u2014 but a trifle crude . But I 'm free now . Unfortunately my freedom comes too late . Podbury 's Titania is much too enamoured of those ass 's ears of his \u2014\u2014 How the brute will chuckle when he hears of this ! But he wo n't hear of it from me . I 'll go in and pack and be off to-morrow morning before he 's up ! NEXT MORNING ; IN THE HALL OF THE GRAND HOTEL DANDOLO . THE GERMAN PORTERIn von momendt , Matam , I attend to you . You want a larcher roum , Sare ? You address ze manager , blease . Your dronks , Laties ? I haf zem brod down , yes .", "I really think I might almost venture to go down now , eh ,", "There is no reason that I 'm aware of , why I should be \u2014 butdo n't you think we had better wait till we are alone to discuss that subject ?", "So you actually suspect me of having carried on a flirtation !", "Does that strike you as so very incredible ?", "Er \u2014 I have brought you the philosophical work I mentioned . I will leave it for an occasion when you are \u2014 er \u2014 in a fitter frame of mind for its perusal .", "Well , I brought an Epitome of Herbert Spencer 's Synthetic Philosophy away with me to dip into occasionally . It seems a very able summary , and you are welcome to it , if it 's of any use to you .", "Thanks , but I am no equestrian .He seems to manage well enough without me . And yet I do think my society would be more good for him than \u2014\u2014. Why did he want to borrow that book , though ? Can my influence after all \u2014\u2014ON THE TERRACE OF THE BURG . HALF AN HOUR LATER .", "Ssh ! She 's just turned the corner !", "Really , this is most unpardonable of Mr. Podbury ! To have such odious calumnies circulated about one behind one 's back is simply too \u2014\u2014 I do not aspire to \u2014 ah \u2014 to tickle folks to death !", "Then shall we just drift about in a gondola all the morning , and \u2014 er \u2014 perhaps do the Academy later ?", "Why \u2014 er \u2014 really , on so delicate a matter , I \u2014 I \u2014\u2014", "If I have succeeded in advancing your cause with Miss", "Which I shall be delighted to give , if you will put me in possession of the \u2014 er \u2014 facts .", "I \u2014 ah \u2014 have the best reasons for feeling tolerably certain of it .", "You are not required to see . I do n't WISH it , that is all . I \u2014 er \u2014 think that should be sufficient .", "I warned you how it would be ! We shall have this sort of thing all the afternoon now !", "Well , we might take a turn later on , and see the effect of St. Gudule in the moonlight .", "And what did the tunny \u2014 I mean the Manager \u2014 say to that ?", "You 'll be grateful to me by-and-by .", "I can quite understand that . I \u2014 I mean that it reduces the \u2014 er \u2014 paralysing sense of irrevocability .", "\u201c Yours just received . Am returning immediately . \u201d", "No \u2014 only pained by such a travesty of a noble name . \u201c Scallywags \u201d for Scaligers seems to me , if I may say so , a very cheap form of humour !", "What sort of impression do you suppose I should get of Venice with a blue veil on ?", "Lighting a \u201c fidibus . \u201d Splendid thing to drive out mosquitoes .", "No \u2014 but considering that we start the first thing to-morrow morning , would n't it be as well to have some idea of where you 're going ? And , by the way , excuse me , but is it altogether prudent to keep your tickets in an outside pocket like that ? I always keep mine , with my money , in a special case in an inner pocket , with a buttoned flap \u2014 then I know I can n't lose them .", "Oh \u2014 er \u2014 Podbury , I 'm off . Going to lunch somewhere with the \u2014 ah \u2014 Trotters . See you at table d'hote this evening , I suppose ? Good-bye .", "I do mind \u2014 I must . I am not accustomed to hear myself called a \u2014 a jabberer !", "I could not have believed any amount of bites could have made such a terrible difference in her . She looks positively plain ! I do trust they 're not permanent , or really \u2014\u2014!CHAPTER XXI . + Wearing Rue with a Difference .+ SCENE \u2014 The Steps of the Hotel Dandolo , about 11 A. M. PODBURY is looking expectantly down the Grand Canal , CULCHARD is leaning upon the Balustrade .", "Just so \u2014 how are you ? Er \u2014 will you excuse me ?", "Rowing be \u2014\u2014No ; but just consider , my dear Podbury . I assure you you 'll find Nuremberg a most delightful old place . You must see how bent I am on going there !", "By all means .", "Er \u2014 I rather thought of the Engadine \u2014 more bracing , eh ?\u2014 few-feedle-eedle-oodle \u2014\u2014", "Offended ?Hardly that . Hurt ? Well , I confess to being pained \u2014 very much pained , to discover that I was unconsciously pitted \u2014 against Podbury !", "Birds do n't lay \u2014 er \u2014 I mean they do n't sing , in the dark . My light has been \u2014 er \u2014 lacking of late .", "So it appears .Had his quietus , evidently . Ah , well , I wo n't exult over him .", "It 's very unfortunate that she will insist on idealizing me like this !", "You especially , my dear Podbury . In fact , I doubt if you 're half grateful enough !", "I did not say so . But I am not prepared to deny that I have been waiting here with some such expectation .", "If that 's your idea of a joke , all I can say is \u2014\u2014", "All I am driving at is this : Could n't we two \u2014 er \u2014 agree to effect a reconciliation between the two ladies ? So much pleasanter for \u2014 er \u2014 all parties !", "That has its charm , no doubt . But do n't you find Miss Prendergast a mine of information on Italian Art and History ?", "I should not advise you to do so . It is possible she may have gone there with the \u2014 er \u2014 expectation of being joined by \u2014 by somebody else .", "You have chosen an inspiring scene , rich with historical interest .", "It is most unsatisfactory ; but at least Podbury is disposed of ! The same Scene , a quarter of an hour later . PODBURY and MISS PRENDERGAST .", "It would not be at all the same thing \u2014 even if he \u2014 but you do think you 're coming to Nuremberg , do n't you ?", "Not if I can prevent it , though !", "I should like to be at Nuremberg with you . It would be an unspeakable delight to watch the expansion of a fresh young soul in that rich mediaeval atmosphere !", "I know . I mean , you told me that before . And I have tasted tunny .", "She said she had a headache , and made her father and Van Boodeler go out on the lake without her . But she certainly gave me to understand that she might come out when the band played , if she felt better . The question is , whether she means to feel better or not . She is the most tantalizing girl ! I do n't know what to make of her . Not a single reference , as yet , to that last talk we had at Bingen . I must see if I can n't recall it to her memory \u2014 if she comes . I 'll wait here , on the chance of it \u2014 we are not likely to be dis \u2014\u2014. Confound it all \u2014 Podbury !Well , do you want anything in particular ?", "I will undertake to interest him in Nuremberg . Fortunately , we are all getting off at Bingen , and going , curiously enough , to the same hotel .Confound that fellow Podbury , here he is again !", "This is too bad , Podbury ! you must have been there , or you could n't possibly know !", "Er \u2014 yes \u2014 thought I might as well be getting back .", "Profoundly true , indeed . I often think I could like him better if there were less in him to like . I assure you he tries me so at times that I could almost wish I was back at work in my department at Somerset House !", "Now that 's coarse \u2014 really coarse !\u2014\u2014 I seem to be unable to open my mouth now without some ridiculous distortion \u2014\u2014", "I really have n't troubled to speculate . Who can tell how one may , quite unconsciously , give offence \u2014 even to those who are \u2014 er \u2014 comparative strangers ?", "I beg you will not think it necessary . He \u2014 he has a guide already . He does not require my services . And , to be plain , my poor friend \u2014 though an excellent fellow according to his \u2014 ah \u2014 lights \u2014 is a companion whose society occasionally amounts to a positive infliction .", "If I did n't , the mosquitoes would come in again .", "It 's not of vital importance if she did .Few-fee-fee-foo-foodle-di-fee-di-fa-foo .", "Only the mausoleums of the Doges \u2014 Ruskin 's \u201c Street of the Tombs \u201d \u2014 and a few trifles of that sort !", "It does feel a little inflamed .

What was it ?", "I do n't see how we can change all the tickets , really . If you like , we could stop a week at St. Goarshausen .", "My dear Podbury , we shall have ample time to talk about her while we are at Nuremberg together \u2014 it will be the greatest pleasure to me to do so as long as you please .", "Ah , Miss Prendergast , do n't lose your faith in human nature ! Trust me , it is \u2014 er \u2014 full of surprises !Now am I an abominable humbug , or what ? I swear I felt every word I said , at the time . Curious psychological state to be in . But I 'm out of what might have been a very unpleasant mess , at all events !", "She will be here presently . By the way , my dear Prendergast , this \u2014 er \u2014 misunderstanding between your sister and her is very unfortunate .", "Polite and obliging !

And , by the way , Miss Trotter , I should like to take this opportunity of disabusing your mind of the \u2014 er \u2014 totally false impression \u2014\u2014", "It strikes me , Podbury , that you must find the time rather long , to want a book of that kind . If you wish to resume our \u2014 ah \u2014 original relations , I am quite ready to overlook what I am sure was only a phase of not unnatural disappointment .", "If I can only keep him on at this tunny !And \u2014 er \u2014 what does it taste like exactly , now ?", "Not quite . There 's still a \u2014\u2014 And your probation , that 's practically at an end ?", "I \u2014 er \u2014 must confess I seldom waste time over the humorous literature of any nation .", "So we perceive \u2014 a very sensible plan , no doubt , in some cases , my dear fellow .", "And so you went on to S.

I hope you \u2014 er \u2014 appreciate the inestimable privileges of \u2014 of seeing Venice so thoroughly ?", "Most certainly I do . I am much mistaken in Miss Trotter if she will attach the slightest importance to a mere temporary \u2014 er \u2014 disfigurement . These swellings never do last long . Do they now ?", "As you please .Ca n't meet my eye . Good ! I shall go on treating her distantly for a little . I wonder if I look indifferent enough from behind ? Shall I cross one foot ?

I 'm afraid she 's already beginning to think too much of \u2014 and with my peculiar position with Miss Trotter \u2014\u2014 not that there 's anything definite at present , still \u2014\u2014Ahem , Miss Prendergast \u2014 am I standing as you wish ?She does n't answer \u2014 too absorbed , and I can n't hear that idiot \u2014 found he has n't scored so much after all , and gone off in a huff , I expect . So much the better ! What a time she is over this , and how quiet she keeps ! I wish I knew whether it was coquetry or \u2014 shall I turn round and see ? No , I must be perfectly indifferent . And she did laugh at me . I distinctly saw her . Still , if she 's sorry , this would be an excellent opportunity for \u2014Miss Prendergast !May I take it that you regret having been betrayed into momentary approbation of a miserable piece of flippancy ? If so , let me assure you \u2014Podbury again ! He must have planned this \u2014 with her ! It is too much . I have done \u2014 yes \u2014 done with the pair of them ! CHAPTER X . + Podbury insists on an Explanation .+ SCENE \u2014 A flight of steps by the lake in the grounds of the Insel Hotel , Constance . Time , late afternoon . A small boat , containing three persons , is just visible far out on the glassy grey-green water . BOB PRENDERGAST and PODBURY are perched side by side on a parapet , smoking disconsolately .", "I confess I did not think a few mosquito-bites would have quite such an effect upon you !", "The Bayrischer-Hof . Why ?", "I have certainly not encountered any insuperable difficulties in his works as yet .", "Ah , well , my dear Podbury , one must n't expect too much , must one ?", "Few-fitty-fitty-fitty-fa-di-fee-fee-foo ; few \u2014\u2014 After all , Podbury , I do n't know that I care so much about Nuremberg . They \u2014 they say it 's a good deal changed from what it was .", "It is not ; it is a Government Office , and I am in the Pigeonhole and Docket Department , with important duties to discharge . I hope you did n't imagine I sold ribbons and calico over a counter ?", "Trotter !... They 're sitting down on the grass below !", "Now this is a thing that can only be properly enjoyed when one is by oneself . The mere presence of Podbury \u2014 well , thank goodness , he 's found more congenial company .That looks like an English girl sketching on the next seat . Rather a fine profile , so regular \u2014 general air of repose about her . Singular , now I think of it , how little repose there is about Maud .Dear me , she has left her india-rubber behind her . I really think I ought \u2014\u2014Am I mistaken in supposing that this piece of india-rubber is your property ?", "I \u2014 er \u2014 have not been consulted . Are they \u2014 er \u2014 all going ?", "I am no more conscious of \u201c jawing \u201d than \u201c jabbering , \u201d and if that is how I am to be spoken to \u2014\u2014!", "If Charley Van Boodeler was engaged to her , I suppose he 'd be there . Pshaw ! What does it matter ? Somehow , I rather wish now that I 'd \u2014 but perhaps we shall get into conversation presently . Hang it , here 's that fellow Podbury back again ! Wish to goodness he 'd \u2014\u2014Hallo , so you have n't started yet ?", "See ? I can hear one singing in my ear at this moment .You would open the window !", "We are going through scenery like this , and all you think of is \u2014 lunch !You may give me one of those sandwiches . What made you get veal ? and the bread 's all crust , too ! Thanks , I 'll take some claret ....Dear me , we 're at the top already ! These rocks shut out the valley altogether \u2014 much colder at this height , eh ? Do n't you find this keen air most exhilarating ?", "\u201c I saw from out the wave her structures rise , As from the stroke of the enchanter 's wand . \u201d", "I \u2014 ah \u2014 which lady are you referring to ?Oh ... I \u2014 I see \u2014 precisely , quite so !I beg your pardon , you were describing how you caught a tunny ? Pray continue .", "If you want to know , I am \u201c corking down , \u201d to adopt your elegant expression , a sonnet that suggested itself to me .", "Do n't be too down-hearted , my dear Podbury . I happen to know that she likes you \u2014 she told me as much last night . Did Miss Prendergast \u2014 er \u2014 say anything to that effect about me ?", "By the way , I wish you had n't been in such a hurry to come straight on . I particularly wished to stop at Bruges , and see the Memlings .", "It 's quite impossible to make them hear down there , and it 's no fault of ours if their voices reach us occasionally . And it does seem to me , Podbury , that , in a matter which may be of vital importance to me \u2014 to us both \u2014 it would be absurd to be over-scrupulous . But of course you will please yourself . I intend to remain where I am .", "If I remember rightly , you yourself were not insensible to Miss", "A mean cuss ? Me ! Really , this unjustifiable language is most \u2014\u2014!", "Mean ? because I \u2014\u2014!Now we can examine these monuments in peace \u2014 they are really \u2014 er \u2014 unique examples of the sepulchral pomp of Italian mediaevalism .", "Well , my dear Podbury , our \u2014 er \u2014 expedition has turned out rather disastrously !", "Almost .It is really most refreshing ."]}, "act_index": 27, "play_index": 27}, {"data": {"694": ["Violet powder !

It 's Charley Van Stickinthemud 's turn now ! We 've got to go to Nuremberg . You can n't get out of it , after gassing so much about the place . When you 've once decided , you know , it 's final !", "I do n't allow anything of the sort . She liked me well enough till \u2014 till you came in and set her against me , and you may think it friendly if you like , but I call it shabby \u2014 confoundedly shabby .", "If you only knew what he 's like when he 's nasty , you 'd let me off \u2014 you would , really . But there , to please you , I 'll do it . I 'll stand him as long as ever I can \u2014 \u2018 pon my honour I will .

SCENE \u2014 A Second-Class Compartment on the line between Wurzburg and Nuremberg . PODBURY has been dull and depressed all day , not having recovered from the parting with MISS TROTTER . CULCHARD , on the contrary , is almost ostentatiously cheerful . PODBURY is intensely anxious to find out how far his spirits are genuine , but \u2014 partly from shyness , and partly because some of their fellow travellers have been English \u2014 he has hesitated to introduce the subject . At last , however , they are alone , and he is determined to have it out on the very first opportunity .", "That 's the place for me , then . Or could we push on to Vienna ? Never seen Vienna .", "I say , old boy , I 'd no notion you were such a nailing good chap ? Nein , danky .Cheeky little beggar . But do you really think anything will \u2014 er \u2014 come of it , if we do meet her again \u2014 do you now ?", "More water than ground in a place like this , eh ? But I know what you mean \u2014 we must be duffers if we do n't leave Venice engaged men \u2014 which we 're not as yet , worse luck !", "Together ? That 's a nuisance ! Now we shall have to wait till they separate \u2014 sure to squabble , sooner or later .", "With all the pleasure in life , dear boy \u2014 on your own conditions , you know . I mean , if I pay the piper , I call the tune . Now , I do n't cotton to Nuremberg somehow ; I 'd rather go straight on to Constance ; we could get some rowing there .", "Much obliged , old chap ; but I 'm otherwise engaged . Being kept in order myself . Oh , I like it , you know . She 's developing my mind like winking . Spent the whole morning at the Brera , mugging up these old Italian Johnnies . They really are clinkers , you know . Raphael , eh ?\u2014 and Giotto , and Mantegna , and all that lot . As Hypatia says , for intensity of \u2014 er \u2014 religious feeling , and \u2014 and subtlety of symbolism , and \u2014 and so on , they simply take the cake \u2014 romp in , and the rest nowhere ! I 'm getting quite the connoisseur , I can tell you !", "Look here , old fellow , Miss Prendergast would like to sit down , I know ; so do n't you bother about keeping with us if you 'd rather not , you know !", "One minute , Culchard .I say , for goodness \u2019 sake , do n't let 's have that old organ-grinding Johnny in the coupe with us !", "Nothing ? What became of the green coat and white waistcoat , then , eh ?", "Bruges , eh ? Capital ! Anything particular going on there ? No ? It do n't matter . And Ghent \u2014 let 's see , was n't that where they brought the good news from ? Yes , we 'll stop at Ghent \u2014 if we 've time . Then \u2014 Brussels ? Good deal of work to be done there , I suppose , sightseeing , and that ? I like a place where you can moon about without being bothered myself ; now , at Brussels \u2014 never mind , I was only thinking .", "Only that I mean to propose too . I dare say my chances are as good as yours \u2014 even now .", "Neither , as it happens . I 'm for Bingen , too , as you wo n't go anywhere else . Though you did say when we started , that the advantage of travelling like this was that we could go on or stop just as the fancy took us !", "Do n't I just \u2014 rather too deep for me , y \u2019 know ! I say , is n't Miss", "Uppersole ? No \u2014 he 's over at Cadenabbia , I believe .", "I know as well as you do that we are booked for Nuremberg ; but what I say is \u2014 that 's no earthly reason why we should go there !", "The deuce she did n't ! Did she tell you Ruskin 's ideas about courtship being a probation , and ask you if you were ready to be under vow for her , by any chance ?", "I say , old chappie , bar fireworks , you know ! What the deuce are you up to over there ?", "It \u2014 it 's quite decent . It was new when I came away ! BOBHang it all , Patia ! Do you want him to come out in a chimney-pot ? Jump in , old fellow , never mind your tile ?", "Oh , I do n't know that I care about lunch myself \u2014 much .", "No , look here , my friend ; you go and tell that gentleman all about it; he 's very interested in hearing what Napoleon wore or did n't wear .GUIDEBot ven zey com qvite nearer , zey vind ze rade line no ze Inglis soldiers \u2014 nossing bot a breek vall , viz ze moskets \u2014 \u201c Prown Pesses , \u201d you coal dem \u2014 shdeekin out of ze \u2018 oles !

Podbury is unpleasantly Surprised . SCENE \u2014 The Wiertz Museum at Brussels , a large and well-lighted gallery containing the works of the celebrated Belgian , which are reducing a limited number of spectators to the usual degree of stupefaction . Enter CULCHARD , who seats himself on a central ottoman .", "You have , and no mistake . She 's regularly taken me in hand , do n't you know \u2014 she says I 've no intelligent appreciation of Italian Art ; and gad , I believe she 's right there ! But I 'm pulling up \u2014 bound to teach you a lot , seeing all the old altar-pieces I do ! And she gives me the right tips , do n't you see ; she 's no end of a clever girl , so well-read and all that ! But I say \u2014 about Miss Trotter ? Do n't want to be inquisitive , you know , but you do n't seem to be much about with her .", "Do n't see that either . Not going to let that beast , Van Boodeler , have it all his own way !", "No , \u201c Ignoto Fiammingo , \u201d do n't you know . I like that chap 's style \u2014 what I call thoroughly Venetian .", "Now drop it , Culchard , do you hear ? I wo n't hear a word against either of them . It serves us jolly well right for not knowing our own minds better \u2014 though I no more dreamed that old Bob would \u2014\u2014 Oh , hang it , I can n't talk about it yet !", "I 'm looking , old chap . It 's all there , right enough !", "For rest , see guide-books , passim , eh ? Hanged if I can see any structures with this thing on , though ! Let 's have it off , eh ?Hi ! Otez-moi ceci . entendez-vous ?Now a London cabby would see what I wanted at once . This chap 's a fool !", "Oh \u2014 but you find him plain-sailing enough , I suppose ?", "He should n't try to make me out a bigger duffer than I am , then . But I say , you do n't really think it was too bad ? Ah , you 're laughing \u2014 you do n't !", "No , but I mean to say \u2014 does it come up to the mark in the scenery line , you know ?", "Oh , ta-ta !And that 's the fellow who said he wanted to keep out of making friends ! How the dickens am I going to get through the time by myself ?Here , that 's enough for one day .", "I 'll risk it . It must be a devilish funny joke to tickle you like that . Come , out with it !", "Glad to hear it .\u2018 Jove , if he only knew what I know !", "Wonder how long I shall take to get over Culchard 's manner .I wish old Hughie was coming \u2014 he 'd give me a leg over !

It is just after table d'hote ; PODBURY and CULCHARD are sitting on a covered terrace , with coffee . PODBURYNot such a bad dinner ! Expect they 'll rook us a lot for it , though . Rather fun , seeing the waiters all troop in with a fresh course , when the proprietor rang his bell . Like a ballet at the Empire \u2014 eh ? CULCHARDI 'm not in a position to say .

CHAPTER XXIII . + PEARLS AND PIGS .+ SCENE \u2014 The Lower Hall of the Scuola di San Rocco , Venice . British Tourists discovered studying the Tintorets on the walls and ceiling by the aid of Ruskin , Hare , and Baedeker , from which they read aloud , instructively , to one another . MISS PRENDERGAST has brought \u201c The Stones of Venice \u201d for the benefit of her brother and PODBURY . Long self-repression has reduced PODBURY to that unpleasantly hysterical condition known as \u201c a fit of the giggles , \u201d which , however , has hitherto escaped detection .", "So shall I . No end of a shirty letter from the Governor . Wants to know how much longer I expect him to be tied to the office . Old humbug , when he only turns up twice a week for a couple of hours !", "Rather ! Told her it was t'other way round , and I was looking after you . Said you were suffering from melancholia , but were not absolutely dangerous .", "The same to you , and many of \u2018 em , old chap ! Hullo , we 're going to stop at this inn . Let 's get out and stretch our legs and have some coffee .", "Glass up , Gondolier ... stifling in this cab ... drive me ... nearest Doge .", "Come , old chap , do n't get your shirt out with me . Not my fault if she 's found out you think yourself too big a swell for her , is it ?", "There were only two seats on that coach , and they would n't wait for the next . I do n't know why , unless it was that they saw you coming down the steps . She can n't stand you at any price .", "Not dull \u2014 a trifle out of sorts , that 's all . Fact is , I do n't think Venice agrees with me . All this messing about down beastly back-courts and canals and in stuffy churches \u2014 it can n't be healthy , you know ! And they 've no drainage . I only hope I have n't caught something , as it is . I 've that kind of sinking feeling , and a general lowness \u2014 She says I lunch too heavily \u2014 but I swear it 's more than that !", "Much better cork that up , old chap \u2014 had n't he , Miss Trotter ?", "I 've no occasion for any at present , thank you .CHAPTER V . Culchard has the Best of it . SCENE \u2014 Upper deck of the Rhine Steamer , Koenig Wilhelm , somewhere between Bonn and Bingen . The little tables on deck are occupied by English , American , and German tourists , drinking various liquids , from hock to Pilsener beer , and eating veal cutlets . MR. CYRUS K. TROTTER is on the lower deck , discussing the comparative merits of the New York hotels with a fellow countryman . MISS MAUD S. TROTTER is seated on the afterdeck in close conversation with CULCHARD . PODBURY is perched on a camp-stool in the forward part . Near him a British Matron , with a red-haired son , in a green and black blazer , and a blue flannel nightcap , and a bevy of rabbit-faced daughters , are patronising a tame German Student in spectacles , who speaks a little English .", "But I thought you said you 'd been speaking up for me ! What did you talk about then ?", "Oh , that 's it , is it ? But look here , why not tit up whether we go on or stay ?", "Go on \u2014 never mind me . Bless you , I 'm under vow for her too , my dear boy . Fact !", "Thanks \u2014 I wo n't trouble you . Only it does seem rather rough on fellows , do n't you know . If every one went on his plan \u2014 well , there would n't be many marriages ! Still , I never thought you 'd say \u201c Yes \u201d right off . It 's like my cheek , I know , to ask you at all ; you 're so awfully clever and that . And if there 's a chance for me , I 'm game for anything in the way of a trial . Do n't make it stiffer than you can help , that 's all !", "Well , I 'll just trouble you to explain this \u2014 wait a bit .Ah , here we are \u2014 \u201c And these illusive and primordial cognitions , or pseud-ideas , are homogeneous entities which may be differentiated objectively or subjectively , according as they are presented as Noumenon or Phenomenon .

The apricot-tinted diaper on the facade of the Ducal Palace is already distinguishable , and behind its battlements the pearl-grey domes of St. Mark 's shimmer in the warm air . CULCHARD and PODBURY have hardly exchanged a sentence as yet . The former has just left off lugubriously whistling as much as he can remember of \u201c Che faro , \u201d the latter is still humming \u201c The Dead March in Saul , \u201d although in a livelier manner than at first .", "We 're right enough , if the horses do n't happen to stumble . That off-leader is n't over sure-footed \u2014 did you see that ?But what 's the joke about Miss Prendergast ?", "Oh very , do you mind putting your window up ? Thanks . You seem uncommon chirpy to-day . Beginning to get over it , eh ?", "But wo n't you come ? Do . I shall be awfully glad if you will !", "Come along , then \u2014 only look sharp . Sure you do n't mind ? Miss Trotter will be there , you know !", "Well , but look here \u2014 why not stop at Bacharach , and see what sort of a place it is ?", "How on earth are we going to get that beggar out ? Set the Conductor at him , Culchard , do \u2014 you can talk the lingo best !", "If she 's carrying on with that fellow , Culchard , to provoke me , I 'll soon show her how little I \u2014I say , old man , hope I 'm not interrupting you , but I just want to speak to you for a minute , if Miss Trotter will excuse us . Is there any particular point in going as far as Bingen to-night , eh ?", "Well ,\u2014 not exactly , old chap \u2014 not to me , at least . But I say , Miss Trotter did n't tell you that ? Not really ? Hooray ! Then it 's all right \u2014 she may have me after all !", "I see ; I 'd better clear out till the poetry has all gurgled out of him , eh ? Is that the idea ?", "Certainly , old chap . I like you to talk , only not \u2014 not against", "But you just said you had a faither !", "If you ask me , I should call it a simply footling show \u2014 but you were long enough over it .What 's up now ? Nothing gone wrong with the works , eh ?", "Go home ? Why , I can wire to the governor for more , easily enough . We shall have to stay here till it comes , that 's all .", "Well , old chap , your resigning like that has made all the difference to me , I can tell you !", "I \u2014 I dare say . Forgotten all I learnt at school , you know !", "Are they ? A lot of the Venetians seem to wear \u2018 em .Now what are we going to do \u2014 just potter about ?", "My aunt !", "I know . Look here , it 's no use . You must go to Florence by yourself . I simply do n't feel up to it , and that 's the truth . I shall just potter about here till \u2014 till they go .", "Another gone !So you are n't going down to the Cloisters to-night ? I 'm told there 's to be some fun there \u2014 Hide-and-seek , or something \u2014 first-rate place for it , especially now the moon 's up !", "Done with you !Sudden death . You 're Eagle \u2014 I 'm the other Johnny .Eagle ! Confound you ! But I mean to have my innings all the same .", "Oh , are they ? Any way , you 've fetched up your average here . Were n't there enough in the Museum for you ?", "Fancy I saw her down below just now \u2014 with Bob . I expect they 're walking round under the arches .", "Um \u2014 I should be more enchanted if I ever had the faintest notion what the great thinker was driving at . Look here \u2014 here 's a simple little sentence for you !\u201c Let us therefore bear in mind the following :\u2014 That of the whole incident force affecting an aggregate , the effective force is that which remains after deducting the non-effective , that the temporarily effective and the permanently effective vary inversely , and that the molar and molecular changes wrought by the permanently effective force also vary inversely . \u201dAnd that 's only in an Epitome , mind you !", "Oh , that 's all right , old fellow . I 've got over all that business .How soon did you think of moving on ?", "Well , it 's poor fun having to go alone !", "It 's not so easy to tell him as you think . We have n't been on speaking terms these three days . And , after allwe 're supposed to be travelling together , do n't you know ! You might drop him a hint now .", "Safe enough \u2014 unless the wheel catches one \u2014 it was as near as a toucher just then \u2014 are n't you going to smoke ? No ? I am . By the way , what were you so amused about just now , eh ?", "I ?\u2014 is it likely ! I \u2014 I admire her awfully , you know , only she rather seemed to snub me lately .", "Not by way of a change ? Ah , well , it 's a pity \u2014 but I must put up with you as you are , I suppose . You see \u2014\u2014 I 've got that vow to work out .", "Oh , she 'll come round all right , never fear . I only wish I was half as safe with Miss Trotter !", "I \u2014 I 'm really most awfully sorry \u2014 but it came over me suddenly , and I simply could n't help myself !", "So can I hear you buzzing . How the dickens is a fellow to get to sleep while you 're playing Punch and Judy in there ?", "But that cousin of hers \u2014 Charley , you know \u2014 how about him ?", "Eagle ! we 're even so far .This settles it .", "Then I 'm jolly glad you did n't call me earlier , that 's all !", "They take to it like birds . And \u2014 curious thing \u2014 after he 'd tried it a month , all the cows turned yellow and went about chirping and twittering and hopping . Fact , I assure you !", "I \u2014 I did see them \u2014 all of them , on my honour I did ! But it gives me such a crick in my neck !", "Bob , you \u2014 you do n't think your sister really \u2014\u2014 eh ?", "Oh , of course it 's very jolly .

Through the open-work of the parapet is seen the vast Piazza , with its yellow toy tram cars , and the small crawling figures which cast inordinately long shadows .

THE PREFACE . If wit has truly been defined , \u201c a propriety of thoughts and words ,\" then that definition will extend to all sorts of poetry ; and , among the rest , to this present entertainment of an opera . Propriety of thought is that fancy which arises naturally from the subject , or which the poet adapts to it ; propriety of words is the clothing of those thoughts with such expressions as are naturally proper to them ; and from both these , if they are judiciously performed , the delight of poetry results . An opera is a poetical tale , or fiction , represented by vocal and instrumental music , adorned with scenes , machines , and dancing . The supposed persons of this musical drama are generally supernatural , as gods , and goddesses , and heroes , which at least are descended from them , and are in due time to be adopted into their number . The subject , therefore , being extended beyond the limits of human nature , admits of that sort of marvellous and surprising conduct , which is rejected in other plays . Human impossibilities are to be received as they are in faith ; because , where gods are introduced , a supreme power is to be understood , and second causes are out of doors ; yet propriety is to be observed even here . The gods are all to manage their peculiar provinces ; and what was attributed by the heathens to one power , ought not to be performed by any other . Phoebus must foretel , Mercury must charm with his caduceus , and Juno must reconcile the quarrels of the marriage-bed ; to conclude , they must all act according to their distinct and peculiar characters . If the persons represented were to speak upon the stage , it would follow , of necessity , that the expressions should be lofty , figurative , and majestical : but the nature of an opera denies the frequent use of these poetical ornaments ; for vocal music , though it often admits a loftiness of sound , yet always exacts an harmonious sweetness ; or , to distinguish yet more justly , the recitative part of the opera requires a more masculine beauty of expression and sound . The other , which , for want of a proper English word , I must call the songish part , must abound in the softness and variety of numbers ; its principal intention being to please the hearing , rather than to gratify the understanding . It appears , indeed , preposterous at first sight , that rhyme , on any consideration , should take place of reason ; but , in order to resolve the problem , this fundamental proposition must be settled , that the first inventors of any art or science , provided they have brought it to perfection , are , in reason , to give laws to it ; and , according to their model , all after-undertakers are to build . Thus , in epic poetry , no man ought to dispute the authority of Homer , who gave the first being to that masterpiece of art , and endued it with that form of perfection in all its parts , that nothing was wanting to its excellency . Virgil therefore , and those very few who have succeeded him , endeavoured not to introduce , or innovate , any thing in a design already perfected , but imitated the plan of the inventor ; and are only so far true heroic poets , as they have built on the foundations of Homer . Thus , Pindar , the author of those Odes , which are so admirably restored by Mr Cowley in our language , ought for ever to be the standard of them ; and we are bound , according to the practice of Horace and Mr Cowley , to copy him . Now , to apply this axiom to our present purpose , whosoever undertakes the writing of an opera , which is a modern invention , though built indeed on the foundation of ethnic worship , is obliged to imitate the design of the Italians , who have not only invented , but brought to perfection , this sort of dramatic musical entertainment . I have not been able , by any search , to get any light , either of the time when it began , or of the first author ; but I have probable reasons , which induce me to believe , that some Italians , having curiously observed the gallantries of the Spanish Moors at their zambras , or royal feasts , where music , songs , and dancing , were in perfection , together with their machines , which are usual at their sortija , or running at the ring , and other solemnities , may possibly have refined upon those moresque divertisements , and produced this delightful entertainment , by leaving out the warlike part of the carousals , and forming a poetical design for the use of the machines , the songs , and dances . But however it began ,we know , that , for some centuries , the knowledge of music has flourished principally in Italy , the mother of learning and of arts; that poetry and painting have been there restored , and so cultivated by Italian masters , that all Europe has been enriched out of their treasury ; and the other parts of it , in relation to those delightful arts , are still as much provincial to Italy , as they were in the time of the Roman empire . Their first operas seem to have been intended for the celebration of the marriages of their princes , or for the magnificence of some general time of joy ; accordingly , the expences of them were from the purse of the sovereign , or of the republic , as they are still practised at Venice , Rome , and at other places , at their carnivals . Savoy and Florence have often used them in their courts , at the weddings of their dukes ; and at Turin particularly , was performed the \u201c Pastor Fido , \u201d written by the famous Guarini , which is a pastoral opera made to solemnise the marriage of a Duke of Savoy . The prologue of it has given the design to all the French ; which is a compliment to the sovereign power by some god or goddess ; so that it looks no less than a kind of embassy from heaven to earth . I said in the beginning of this preface , that the persons represented in operas are generally gods , goddesses , and heroes descended from them , who are supposed to be their peculiar care ; which hinders not , but that meaner persons may sometimes gracefully be introduced , especially if they have relation to those first times , which poets call the Golden Age ; wherein , by reason of their innocence , those happy mortals were supposed to have had a more familiar intercourse with superior beings ; and therefore shepherds might reasonably be admitted , as of all callings the most innocent , the most happy , and who , by reason of the spare time they had , in their almost idle employment , had most leisure to make verses , and to be in love ; without somewhat of which passion , no opera can possibly subsist . It is almost needless to speak any thing of that noble language , in which this musical drama was first invented and performed . All , who are conversant in the Italian , cannot but observe , that it is the softest , the sweetest , the most harmonious , not only of any modern tongue , but even beyond any of the learned . It seems indeed to have been invented for the sake of poetry and music ; the vowels are so abounding in all words , especially in terminations of them , that , excepting some few monosyllables , the whole language ends in them . Then the pronunciation is so manly , and so sonorous , that their very speaking has more of music in it than Dutch poetry and song . It has withal derived , so much copiousness and eloquence from the Greek and Latin , in the composition of words , and the formation of them , that if , after all , we must call it barbarous , it is the most beautiful and most learned of any barbarism in modern tongues ; and we may , at least , as justly praise it , as Pyrrhus did the Roman discipline and martial order , that it was of barbarians ,but had nothing in it of barbarity . This language has in a manner been refined and purified from the Gothic ever since the time of Dante , which is above four hundred years ago ; and the French , who now cast a longing eye to their country , are not less ambitious to possess their elegance in poetry and music ; in both which they labour at impossibilities . It is true , indeed , they have reformed their tongue , and brought both their prose and poetry to a standard ; the sweetness , as well as the purity , is much improved , by throwing off the unnecessary consonants , which made their spelling tedious and their pronunciation harsh : but , after all , as nothing can be improved beyond its own species , or farther than its original nature will allow ; as an ill voice , though ever so thoroughly instructed in the rules of music , can never be brought to sing harmoniously , nor many an honest critic ever arrive to be a good poet ; so neither can the natural harshness of the French , or their perpetual ill accent , be ever refined into perfect harmony like the Italian . The English has yet more natural disadvantages than the French ; our original Teutonic , consisting most in monosyllables , and those incumbered with consonants , cannot possibly be freed from those inconveniencies . The rest of our words , which are derived from the Latin chiefly , and the French , with some small sprinklings of Greek , Italian , and Spanish , are some relief in poetry , and help us to soften our uncouth numbers ; which , together with our English genius , incomparably beyond the trifling of the French , in all the nobler parts of verse , will justly give us the pre-eminence . But , on the other hand , the effeminacy of our pronunciation ,and our scarcity of female rhymes , have left the advantage of musical composition for songs , though not for recitative , to our neighbours . Through these difficulties I have made a shift to struggle in my part of the performance of this opera ; which , as mean as it is , deserves at least a pardon , because it has attempted a discovery beyond any former undertaker of our nation ; only remember , that if there be no north-east passage to be found , the fault is in nature , and not in me ; or , as Ben Jonson tells us in \u201c The Alchymist , \u201d when projection had failed , and the glasses were all broken , there was enough , however , in the bottoms of them , to cure the itch ; so I may thus be positive , that if I have not succeeded as I desire , yet there is somewhat still remaining to satisfy the curiosity , or itch of sight and hearing . Yet I have no great reason to despair ; for I may , without vanity , own some advantages , which are not common to every writer ; such as are the knowledge of the Italian and French language , and the being conversant with some of their best performances in this kind ; which have furnished me with such variety of measures as have given the composer , Monsieur Grabut , what occasions he could wish , to shew his extraordinary talent in diversifying the recitative , the lyrical part , and the chorus ; in all which , not to attribute any thing to my own opinion , the best judges and those too of the best quality , who have honoured his rehearsals with their presence , have no less commended the happiness of his genius than his skill . And let me have the liberty to add one thing , that he has so exactly expressed my sense in all places where I intended to move the passions , that he seems to have entered into my thoughts , and to have been the poet as well as the composer . This I say , not to flatter him , but to do him right ; because amongst some English musicians , and their scholars , who are sure to judge after them , the imputation of being a Frenchman is enough to make a party , who maliciously endeavour to decry him . But the knowledge of Latin and Italian poets , both which he possesses , besides his skill in music , and his being acquainted with all the performances of the French operas , adding to these the good sense to which he is born , have raised him to a degree above any man , who shall pretend to be his rival on our stage . When any of our countrymen excel him , I shall be glad , for the sake of old England , to be shewn my error ; in the mean time , let virtue be commended , though in the person of a strangerIf I thought it convenient , I could here discover some rules which I have given to myself in writing of an opera in general , and of this opera in particular ; but I consider , that the effect would only be , to have my own performance measured by the laws I gave ; and , consequently , to set up some little judges , who , not understanding thoroughly , would be sure to fall upon the faults , and not to acknowledge any of the beauties ; an hard measure , which I have often found from false critics . Here , therefore , if they will criticise , they shall do it out of their own fond ; but let them first be assured that their ears are nice ; for there is neither writing nor judgment on this subject without that good quality . It is no easy matter , in our language , to make words so smooth , and numbers so harmonious , that they shall almost set themselves . And yet there are rules for this in nature , and as great a certainty of quantity in our syllables , as either in the Greek or Latin : but let poets and judges understand those first , and then let them begin to study English . When they have chewed a while upon these preliminaries , it may be they will scarce adventure to tax me with want of thought and elevation of fancy in this work ; for they will soon be satisfied , that those are not of the nature of this sort of writing . The necessity of double rhimes , and ordering of the words and numbers for the sweetness of the voice , are the main hinges on which an opera must move ; and both of these are without the compass of any art to teach another to perform , unless nature , in the first place , has done her part , by enduing the poet with that nicety of hearing , that the discord of sounds in words shall as much offend him , as a seventh in music would a good composer . I have therefore no need to make excuses for meanness of thought in many places : the Italians , with all the advantages of their language , are continually forced upon it , or , rather , affect it . The chief secret is the choice of words ; and , by this choice , I do not here mean elegancy of expression , but propriety of sound , to be varied according to the nature of the subject . Perhaps a time may come when I may treat of this more largely , out of some observations which I have made from Homer and Virgil , who , amongst all the poets , only understood the art of numbers , and of that which was properly called rhythmus by the ancients . The same reasons , which depress thought in an opera , have a stronger effect upon the words , especially in our language ; for there is no maintaining the purity of English in short measures , where the rhime returns so quick , and is so often female , or double rhime , which is not natural to our tongue , because it consists too much of monosyllables , and those , too , most commonly clogged with consonants ; for which reason I am often forced to coin new words , revive some that are antiquated , and botch others ; as if I had not served out my time in poetry , but was bound apprentice to some doggrel rhimer , who makes songs to tunes , and sings them for a livelihood . It is true , I have not been often put to this drudgery ; but where I have , the words will sufficiently shew , that I was then a slave to the composition , which I will never be again : it is my part to invent , and the musician 's to humour that invention . I may be counselled , and will always follow my friend 's advice where I find it reasonable , but will never part with the power of the militiaI am now to acquaint my reader with somewhat more particular concerning this opera , after having begged his pardon for so long a preface to so short a work . It was originally intended only for a prologue to a play of the nature of \u201c The Tempest ; \u201d which is a tragedy mixed with opera , or a drama , written in blank verse , adorned with scenes , machines , songs , and dances , so that the fable of it is all spoken and acted by the best of the comedians ; the other part of the entertainment to be performed by the same singers and dancers who were introduced in this present opera . It cannot properly be called a play , because the action of it is supposed to be conducted sometimes by supernatural means , or magic ; nor an opera , because the story of it is not sung .\u2014 But more of this at its proper time .\u2014 But some intervening accidents having hitherto deferred the performance of the main design , I proposed to the actors , to turn the intended Prologue into an entertainment by itself , as you now see it , by adding two acts more to what I had already written . The subject of it is wholly allegorical ; and the allegory itself so very obvious , that it will no sooner be read than understood . It is divided , according to the plain and natural method of every action , into three parts . For even Aristotle himself is contented to say simply , that in all actions there is a beginning , a middle , and an end ; after which model all the Spanish plays are built . The descriptions of the scenes , and other decorations of the stage , I had from Mr Betterton , who has spared neither for industry , nor cost , to make this entertainment perfect , nor for invention of the ornaments to beautify it . To conclude , though the enemies of the composer are not few , and that there is a party formed against him of his own profession , I hope , and am persuaded , that this prejudice will turn in the end to his advantage . For the greatest part of an audience is always uninterested , though seldom knowing ; and if the music be well composed , and well performed , they , who find themselves pleased , will be so wise as not to be imposed upon , and fooled out of their satisfaction . The newness of the undertaking is all the hazard . When operas were first set up in France , they were not followed over eagerly ; but they gained daily upon their hearers , till they grew to that height of reputation , which they now enjoy . The English , I confess , are not altogether so musical as the French ; and yet they have been pleased already with \u201c The Tempest , \u201d and some pieces that followed , which were neither much better written , nor so well composed as this . If it finds encouragement , I dare promise myself to mend my hand , by making a more pleasing fable . In the mean time , every loyal Englishman cannot but be satisfied with the moral of this , which so plainly represents the double restoration of His Sacred Majesty . POSTSCRIPT . This preface being wholly written before the death of my late royal master ,I have now lately reviewed it , as supposing I should find many notions in it , that would require correction on cooler thoughts . After four months lying by me , I looked on it as no longer mine , because I had wholly forgotten it ; but I confess with some satisfaction , and perhaps a little vanity , that I found myself entertained by it ; my own judgment was new to me , and pleased me when I looked on it as another man 's . I see no opinion that I would retract or alter , unless it be , that possibly the Italians went not so far as Spain , for the invention of their operas . They might have it in their own country ; and that by gathering up the shipwrecks of the Athenian and Roman theatres , which we know were adorned with scenes , music , dances , and machines , especially the Grecian . But of this the learned Monsieur Vossius , who has made our nation his second country , is the best , and perhaps the only judge now living . As for the opera itself , it was all composed , and was just ready to have been performed , when he , in honour of whom it was principally made , was taken from us . He had been pleased twice or thrice to command , that it should be practised before him , especially the first and third acts of it ; and publicly declared more than once , that the composition and choruses were more just , and more beautiful , than any he had heard in England . How nice an ear he had in music , is sufficiently known ; his praise therefore has established the reputation of it above censure , and made it in a manner sacred . It is therefore humbly and religiously dedicated to his memory . It might reasonably have been expected that his death must have changed the whole fabric of the opera , or at least a great part of it . But the design of it originally was so happy , that it needed no alteration , properly so called ; for the addition of twenty or thirty lines in the apotheosis of Albion , has made it entirely of a piece , This was the only way which could have been invented , to save it from botched ending ; and it fell luckily into my imagination ; as if there were a kind of fatality even in the most trivial things concerning the succession : a change was made , and not for the worse , without the least confusion or disturbance ; and those very causes , which seemed to threaten us with troubles , conspired to produce our lasting happiness .

This definition occurs in the preface to the \u201c State of Innocence ; \u201d but although given by Dryden , and sanctioned by Pope , it has a very limited resemblance to that which is defined . Mr Addison has , however , mistaken Dryden , in supposing that he applied this definition exclusively to what we now properly call wit . From the context it is plain , that he meant to include all poetical composition .\u2014 Spectator , No . 62 . The word once comprehended human knowledge in general . We still talk of the wit of man , to signify all that man can devise .", "The Trimmers , a body small and unpopular , as must always be the case with those , who in violent times declare for moderate and temporising measures , were headed by the ingenious and politic Halifax . He had much of the confidence , at least of the countenance of Charles , who was divided betwixt tenderness for Monmouth , and love of ease , on the one hand , and , on the other , desire of arbitrary power , and something like fear of the duke of York . Halifax repeatedly prevented each of these parties from subjugating the other , and his ambidexter services seem to have been rewarded by the sincere hatred of both . In 1688 was published a vindication of this party , entitled , \u201c the Character of a Trimmer ; \u201d and his opinion of ,\u2014 I . The laws of government . II . Protestant Religion . III . Foreign affairs . By the Hon . Sir William Coventry . THE VINDICATION : OR , THE PARALLEL OF THE FRENCH HOLY LEAGUE , AND THE ENGLISH LEAGUE AND COVENANT , TURNED INTO A SEDITIOUS LIBEL AGAINST THE KING AND HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS , BY THOMAS HUNT , AND THE AUTHORS OF THE REFLECTIONS UPON THE PRETENDED PARALLEL IN THE PLAY CALLED THE DUKE OF GUISE . Turno tempus erit magno cum optaverit emptum Intactum Pallanta : et cum spolia ista , diemque Oderit .\u2014 VINDICATION OF THE DUKE OF GUISE . It was easy to foresee , that a play , which professed to be a broadside discharged at the whole popular party , would not long remain uncensured . The satire being derived from a historical parallel of some delicacy , offered certain facilities of attack to the critics . It was only stretching the resemblance beyond the bounds to which Dryden had limited it , and the comparison became odious , if not dangerous . The whig writers did not neglect this obvious mode of attack , now rendered more popular by the encroachment lately attempted by the court upon the freedom of the city , whose magistrates had been exposed to ridicule in the play . Our readers cannot but remember , that , in order to break the spirit of the city of London , a writ of quo warranto was issued against the incorporation , by which was instituted a vexatious and captious inquiry into the validity of the charter of London . The purpose of this process was to compel the city to resign their freedom and immunities into the king 's hands , and to receive a new grant of them , so limited , as might be consistent with the views of the crown , or otherwise to declare them forfeited . One Thomas Hunt , a lawyer of some eminence , who had been solicitor for the Viscount Stafford when that unfortunate nobleman was tried for high treason , and had written upon the side of the tories , but had now altered his principles , stepped forward upon this occasion as the champion of the immunities of the city of LondonThe ludicrous light in which the sheriffs are placed , during the scene with Grillon in the third act , gave great offence to this active partizan ; and he gives vent to his displeasure in the following attack upon the author , and the performance . \u201c They have already condemned the charter and city , and have executed the magistrates in effigy upon the stage , in a play called \u201c The Duke of Guise , \u201d frequently acted and applauded ; intended most certainly , to provoke the rabble into tumults and disorder . The Roman priest had no success ,when he animated the people not to suffer the same sheriffs to be carried through the city to the Tower , prisoners . Now the poet hath undertaken , for their being kicked three or four times a-week about the stage to the gallows , infamously rogued and rascalled , to try what he can do towards making the charter forfeitable , by some extravagancy and disorder of the people , which the authority of the best governed cities have not been able to prevent , sometimes under far less provocations . \u201c But this ought not to move the citizens , when he hath so maliciously and mischievously represented the king , and the king 's son , nay , and his favourite the duke too , to whom he gives the worst strokes of his unlucky fancy . \u201c He puts the king under the person of Henry III . of France , who appeared in the head of the Parisian massacre ; the king 's son under the person of the Duke of Guise , who concerted it with the Queen-mother of France , and was slain in that very place , by the righteous judgment of God , where he and his mother had first contrived it . \u201c The Duke of Guise ought to have represented a great prince , that had inserved to some most detestable villany , to please the rage , or lust , of a tyrant . \u201c Such great courtiers have been often sacrificed , to appease the furies of the tyrant 's guilty conscience , to expiate for his sin , and to atone the people . \u201c Besides , that a tyrant naturally stands in fear of ministers of mighty wickedness ; he is always obnoxious to them , he is a slave to them , as long as they live they remember him of his guilt , and awe him . These wicked slaves become most imperious masters : they drag him to greater evils for their own impunity , than they first perpetrated for his pleasure , and their own ambition . \u201c But such are best given up to public justice , but by no means to be assassinated . Until this age , never before was an assassination invited , commended , and encouraged upon a public theatre . \u201c It is no wonder that Trimmersdisplease them ; for they seem to have designs for which it behoves them to know their men ; they must be perfectly wicked , or perfectly deceived ; of the Catiline make ; bold , and without understanding ; that can adhere to men that publicly profess murders , and applaud the design . \u201c Caius C\u00e6sarwas in the Catiline conspiracy ; and then the word was , he that is not for us is against us ; for the instruments of wickedness must be men that are resolute and forward , and without consideration ; or they will deceive the design , and relent when they enterprize . \u201c But when he was made dictator , and had some pretences , and a probability by means less wicked and mischievous to arrive at the government , his words were , he that is not against us is with us . But to Pompey only it belonged , and to his cause , or the like cause , to the defenders of ancient established governments , of the English monarchy and liberties , to say , they that are not with us are against us . In internecino bello , in attacks upon government , medii pro hostibus habentur , neutral men are traitors , and assist , by their indifferency , to the destruction of the government . As many as applaud this play , ought to be put under sureties of the peace ; and yet not one warrant , that we hear of yet , granted by the Lord Chief Justice . \u201c But it is not a Duke of Guise to be assassinated , a turbulent , wicked , and haughty courtier ; but an innocent and gentle prince , as well as brave , and renowned for noble achievements : a prince , that hath no fault , but that he is the king 's son ; and the best too of all his sons ; such a son , as would have made the best of emperors happy . \u201c Except it be , that the people honour him and love him , and every where publicly and loudly show it : But this they do , for that the best people of England have no other way left to show their loyalty to the king , and love to their religion and government , in long intervals of Parliament , than by prosecuting his son , for the sake of the king and his own merit , with all the demonstrations of the highest esteem . \u201c But he hath not used his patron Duke much better ; for he hath put him under a most dismal and unfortunate character of a successor , excluded from the crown by act of state for his religion , who fought his way to the crown , changed his religion , and died by the hand of a Roman assassinate . \u201c It is enough to make his great duke 's courage quail , to find himself under such an unlucky and disastrous representation , and thus personated ; besides , he hath offered a justification of an act of exclusion against a popish successor , in a Protestant kingdom , by remembering what was done against the king of Navarre . \u201c The Popish religion , in France , did , de facto , by act of state , exclude a Protestant prince , who is under no obligation , from his religion , to destroy his Popish subjects . \u201c Though a Popish prince is , to destroy his Protestant subjects . \u201c A Popish prince , to a Protestant kingdom , without more , must be the most insufferable tyrant , and exceed the character that any story can furnish for that sort of monster : And yet all the while to himself a religious and an applauded prince ; discharged from the tortures that ordinarily tear and rend the hearts of the most cruel princes , and make them as uneasy to themselves as they are to their subjects , and sometimes prevail so far as to lay some restraints upon their wicked minds . \u201c But this his patron will impute to his want of judgment ; for this poet 's heroes are commonly such monsters as Theseus and Hercules are , renowned throughout all ages for destroying . \u201c But to excuse him , this man hath forsaken his post , and entered upon another province . To \u201c The Observator \u201dit belongs to confound truth and falsehood ; and , by his false colours and impostures , to put out the eyes of the people , and leave them without understanding . \u201c But our poet hath not so much art left him as to frame any thing agreeable , or verisimilar , to amuse the people , or wherewith to deceive them . \u201c His province is to corrupt the manners of the nation , and lay waste their morals ; his understanding is clapt , and his brains are vitiated , and he is to rot the age . \u201c His endeavours are more happily applied , to extinguish the little remains of the virtue of the age by bold impieties , and befooling religion by impious and inept rhymes , to confound virtue and vice , good and evil , and leave us without consciences . \u201c And thus we are prepared for destruction . \u201c But to give the world a taste of his atheism and impiety , I shall recite two of his verses , as recited upon the stage , viz . For conscience , and heaven 's fear , religious rules , They are all state-bells to toll in pious fools ; which I have done the rather , that some honest judge , or justice , may direct a process against this bold impious man ; or some honest surrogate , or official , may find leisure to proceed , ex officio , against him , notwithstanding at present they are so encumbered with the dissenters . \u201c Such public blasphemies against religion , never were unpunished in any country , or age , but this . \u201c But I have made too long a digression , but that it carries with it some instructions towards the preserving of the honour of your august city , viz . \u201c That you do not hereafter authorise the stage to expose and revile your great officers , and offices , by the indignities yourselves do them ; whilst the Papists clap their hands , and triumph at your public disgraces , and in the hopes they conceive thereby of the ruin of your government , as if that were as sure and certain to them , as it is to us , without doubt , that they once fired it . \u201c And further , for that it was fit to set forth to the world , of what spirit our enemies are , how they intend to attack us ; as also , how bold they are with his majesty , what false and dishonourable representations they make of him , and present to the world upon a public theatre ; which , I must confess , hath moved me with some passion . \u201d This angry barrister was not the only adversary whom Dryden had to encounter on this occasion . Thomas Shadwell , a man of some talents for comedy , and who professed to tread in the footsteps of Ben Jonson , had for some time been at variance with Dryden and Otway . He was probably the author of a poem , entitled , \u201c A Lenten Prologue , refused by the Players ; \u201d which is marked by Mr Luttrel , 11th April , 1683 , and contains the following direct attack on \u201c The Duke of Guise , \u201d and the author : Our prologue wit grows flat ; the nap 's worn off , And howsoe'er we turn and trim the stuff , The gloss is gone that looked at first so gaudy ; \u2018 Tis now no jest to hear young girls talk bawdry . But plots and parties give new matters birth , And state distractions serve you here for mirth . At England 's cost poets now purchase fame ; While factious heats destroy us , without shame , These wanton Neroes fiddle to the flame ; The stage , like old rump-pulpits , is become The scene of news , a furious party 's drum : Here poets beat their brains for volunteers , And take fast hold of asses by their ears ; Their jingling rhimes for reason here you swallow , Like Orpheus \u2019 music , it makes beasts to follow . What an enlightening grace is want of bread ! How it can change a libeller 's heart , and clear a laureat 's head ; Open his eyes , till the mad prophet see Plots working in a future power to be !Traitors unformed to his second sight are clear . And squadrons here and squadrons there appear ; Rebellion is the burden of the seer . To Bayes , in vision , were of late revealed , Whig armies , that at Knightsbridge lay concealed ; And though no mortal eye could see't before , The battle just was entering at the door . A dangerous association , signed by none , The joiner 's plot to seize the king alone . Stephen with Collegemade this dire compact ; The watchful Irish took them in the fact . Of riding armed ; O traitorous overt act ! With each of them an ancient Pistol sided , Against the statute in that case provided . But , why was such a host of swearers pressed ? Their succour was ill husbandry at best . Bayes 's crowned muse , by sovereign right of satire , Without desert , can dub a man a traitor ; And tories , without troubling law or reason , By loyal instinct can find plots and treason . A more formal attack was made in a pamphlet , entitled , \u201c Some Reflections on the pretended parallel in the Play called the Duke of Guise . \u201d This Dryden , in the following Vindication , supposes to have been sketched by Shadwell , and finished by a gentleman of the TempleIn these Reflections , the obvious ground of attack , occupied by Hunt , is again resumed . The general indecency of a theatrical exhibition , which alluded to state-transactions of a grave and most important nature ; the indecorum of comparing the king to such a monarch as Henry III ., infamous for treachery , cruelty , and vices of the most profligate nature ; above all , the parallel betwixt the Dukes of Monmouth and Guise , by which the former is exhibited as a traitor to his father , and recommended as no improper object for assassination \u2014 are topics insisted on at some length , and with great vehemence . Our author was not insensible to these attacks , by which his loyalty to the king , and the decency of his conduct towards Monmouth , the king 's offending , but still beloved , son , and once Dryden 's own patron , stood painfully compromised . Accordingly , shortly after these pamphlets had appeared , the following advertisement was annexed to \u201c The Duke of Guise : \u201d \u201c There was a preface intended to this play in vindication of it , against two scurrilous libels lately printed ; but it was judged , that a defence of this nature would require more room than a preface reasonably could allow . For this cause , and for the importunities of the stationers , who hastened their impression , it is deferred for some little time , and will be printed by itself . Most men are already of opinion , that neither of the pamphlets deserve an answer , because they are stuffed with open falsities , and sometimes contradict each other ; but , for once , they shall have a day or two thrown away upon them , though I break an old custom for their sakes , which was ,\u2014 to scorn them . \u201d The resolution , thus announced , did not give universal satisfaction to our author 's friends ; one of whom published the following remonstrance , which contains some good sense , in very indifferent poetry : An Epode to his worthy Friend JOHN DRYDEN , to advise him not to answer two malicious Pamphlets against his Tragedy called \u201c The Duke of Guise . \u201dCan angry frowns rest on thy noble brow For trivial things ; Or , can a stream of muddy water flow From the Muses \u2019 springs ; Or great Apollo bend his vengeful bow \u2018 Gainst popular stings ? Desist thy passion then ; do not engage Thyself against the wittols of the age . Should we by stiff Tom Thimble 's faction fall , Lord , with what noise The Coffee throats would bellow , and the Ball O \u2019 the Change rejoice , And with the company of Pinner 's Hall Lift up their voice ! Once the head 's gone , the good cause is secure ; The members cannot long resist our power . Crop not their humours ; let the wits proceed Till they have thrown Their venom up ; and made themselves indeed Rare fops o'ergrown : Let them on nasty garbage prey and feed , Till all is done ; And , by thy great resentment , think it fit To crush their hopes , as humble as their wit . Consider the occasion , and you 'll find Yourself severe , And unto rashness much more here inclined , By far , than they 're : Consider them as in their proper kind , \u2018 Tween rage and fear , And then the reason will appear most plain ,\u2014 A worm that 's trod on will turn back again . What if they censure without brain or sense , \u2018 Tis now the fashion ; Each giddy fop endeavours to commence A reformation . Pardon them for their native ignorance , And brainsick passion ; For , after all , true men of sense will say ,\u2014 Their works can never parallel thy play . \u2018 Twere fond to pamper spleen , \u2018 cause owls detest The light of day ; Or real nonsense , which endures no test , Condemns thy play . Lodge not such petty trifles in thy breast , But bar their sway ; And let them know , that thy heroic bays Can scorn their censure , as it doth their praise . Think not thy answer will their nice reclaim , Whose heads are proof Against all reason , and in spite of shame Will stand aloof ; \u2018 Twould cherish further libels on thy fame , Should these thee move . Stand firm , my Dryden , maugre all their plots , Thy bays shall flourish when their ivy rots . But if you are resolved to break your use , And basely sin , In answer ; I 'll be sworn some haggard muse Has you in her gin ; Or in a fit you venture to abuse Your Polyhymn \u2019 , You may serve him so far : But if you do , All your true friends , sir , will reflect on you . The remonstrance of this friendly poet was unavailing ; Dryden having soon after published the following Vindication . Footnotes : 1 . \u201c A Defence of the Charter and Municipal Rights of the City of London , and the Rights of other Municipal Cities and Towns of England . Directed to the Citizens of London , by Thomas Hunt . Si populus vult decipi , decipiatur . London , printed , and to be sold , by Richard Baldwin . \u201d 4to , pages 46 . Wood informs us , that Thomas Hunt , the author , was educated at Queen 's College , Cambridge , and was esteemed a person of quick parts , and of a ready fluency in discourse , but withal too pert and forward . He was called to the bar , and esteemed a good lawyer . In 1659 he became clerk of the assizes at Oxford circuit , but was ejected from the office at the Restoration , to his great loss , to make room for the true owner . He wrote , \u201c An Argument for the Bishops \u2019 right of judging in capital Cases in Parliament , & c .; \u201d for which he expectedno less than to be made lord chief baron of the exchequer in Ireland . But falling short of that honourable office , which he too ambitiously catched at , and considering the loss of another place , which he unjustly possessed , he soon after appeared one of the worst and most inveterate enemies to church and state that was in his time , and the most malicious , and withal the most ignorant , scribbler of the whole herd ; and was thereupon stiled , by a noted author ,Magni nominis umbra . Hunt also published , \u201c Great and weighty Considerations on the Duke of York , & c . \u201d in favour of the exclusion . He had also the boldness to republish his high church tract in favour of the bishops \u2019 jurisdiction , with a whig postscript tending to destroy his own arguments .\u2014 Ath . Ox .

He was certainly a most ineffably impudent , perjured villain .", "During the cabals of the Council of Sixteen , the Duke of Aumale approached Paris with five hundred veteran horse , levied in the disaffected province of Picardy . Jean Conti , one of the sheriffsof Paris , was tampered with to admit them by St Martin 's gate ; but as he refused , the leaguers stigmatised him as a heretic and favourer of Navarre . Another of these officers consented to open to Aumale the gate of St Denis , of which the keys were intrusted to him . The conspirators had determined , as is here expressed , to seize the person of the king , when he should attend the procession of the Flagellants , as he was wont to do in time of Lent . But he was apprised of their purpose by Poltrot , one of their number , and used the pretext of indisposition to excuse his absence from the penitential procession .

See the beginning of the Preface . TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE PHILIP , EARL OF LEICESTER , & c .Far be it from me , my most noble lord , to think , that any thing which my meanness can produce , should be worthy to be offered to your patronage ; or that aught which I can say of you should recommend you farther to the esteem of good men in this present age , or to the veneration which will certainly be paid you by posterity . On the other side , I must acknowledge it a great presumption in me , to make you this address ; and so much the greater , because by the common suffrage even of contrary parties , you have been always regarded as one of the first persons of the age , and yet not one writer has dared to tell you so ; whether we have been all conscious to ourselves that it was a needless labour to give this notice to mankind , as all men are ashamed to tell stale news ; or that we were justly diffident of our own performances , as even Cicero is observed to be in awe when he writes to Atticus ; where , knowing himself over-matched in good sense , and truth of knowledge , he drops the gaudy train of words , and is no longer the vain-glorious orator . From whatever reason it may be , I am the first bold offender of this kind : I have broken down the fence , and ventured into the holy grove . How I may be punished for my profane attempt , I know not ; but I wish it may not be of ill omen to your lordship : and that a crowd of bad writers do not rush into the quiet of your recesses after me . Every man in all changes of government , which have been , or may possibly arrive , will agree , that I could not have offered my incense , where it could be so well deserved . For you , my lord , are secure in your own merit ; and all parties , as they rise uppermost , are sure to court you in their turns ; it is a tribute which has ever been paid your virtue . The leading men still bring their bullion to your mint , to receive the stamp of their intrinsic value , that they may afterwards hope to pass with human kind . They rise and fall in the variety of revolutions , and are sometimes great , and therefore wise in men 's opinions , who must court them for their interest . But the reputation of their parts most commonly follows their success ; few of them are wise , but as they are in power ; because indeed , they have no sphere of their own , but , like the moon in the Copernican system of the world , are whirled about by the motion of a greater planet . This it is to be ever busy ; neither to give rest to their fellow-creatures , nor , which is more wretchedly ridiculous , to themselves ; though , truly , the latter is a kind of justice , and giving mankind a due revenge , that they will not permit their own hearts to be at quiet , who disturb the repose of all beside them . Ambitious meteors ! how willing they are to set themselves upon the wing , and taking every occasion of drawing upward to the sun , not considering that they have no more time allowed them for their mounting , than the short revolution of a day ; and that when the light goes from them , they are of necessity to fall . How much happier is he ,who , centering on himself , remains immoveable , and smiles at the madness of the dance about him ? he possesses the midst , which is the portion of safety and content . He will not be higher , because he needs it not ; but by the prudence of that choice , he puts it out of fortune 's power to throw him down . It is confest , that if he had not so been born , he might have been too high for happiness ; but not endeavouring to ascend , he secures the native height of his station from envy , and cannot descend from what he is , because he depends not on another . What a glorious character was this once in Rome ! I should say , in Athens ; when , in the disturbances of a state as mad as ours , the wise Pomponius transported all the remaining wisdom and virtue of his country into the sanctuary of peace and learning . But I would ask the world ,whether there may not yet be found a character of a noble Englishman , equally shining with that illustrious Roman ? Whether I need to name a second Atticus ? or whether the world has not already prevented me , and fixed it there , without my naming ? Not a second , with a longo sed proximus intervallo ; not a young Marcellus , flattered by a poet into the resemblance of the first , with a frons l\u00e6ta parum , et dejecto lumina vultu , and the rest that follows , si qua fata aspera rumpas , tu Marcellus eris ; but a person of the same stamp and magnitude , who owes nothing to the former , besides the word Roman , and the superstition of reverence , devolving on him by the precedency of eighteen hundred years ; one who walks by him with equal paces , and shares the eyes of beholders with him ; one who had been first , had he first lived ; and , in spite of doating veneration , is still his equal : both of them born of noble families , in unhappy ages of change and tumult ; both of them retiring from affairs of state ; yet not leaving the commonwealth , till it had left itself ; but never returning to public business , when they had once quitted it , though courted by the heads of either party . But who would trust the quiet of their lives with the extravagancies of their countrymen , when they are just in the giddiness of their turning ; when the ground was tottering under them at every moment ; and none could guess whether the next heave of the earthquake would settle them on the first foundation , or swallow it ? Both of them knew mankind exactly well , for both of them began that study in themselves , and there they found the best part of human composition ; the worst they learned by long experience of the folly , ignorance , and immorality of most beside them . Their philosophy , on both sides , was not wholly speculative , for that is barren , and produces nothing but vain ideas of things which cannot possibly be known , or , if they could , yet would only terminate in the understanding ; but it was a noble , vigorous and practical philosophy , which exerted itself in all the offices of pity , to those who were unfortunate , and deserved not so to be . The friend was always more considered by them than the cause ; and an Octavius , or an Antony in distress , were relieved by them , as well as a Brutus or a Cassius ; for the lowermost party , to a noble mind , is ever the fittest object of good-will . The eldest of them , I will suppose , for his honour , to have been of the academic sect , neither dogmatist nor stoick ; if he were not , I am sure he ought , in common justice , to yield the precedency to his younger brother . For stiffness of opinion is the effect of pride , and not of philosophy ; it is a miserable presumption of that knowledge which human nature is too narrow to contain ; and the ruggedness of a stoick is only a silly affectation of being a god ,\u2014 to wind himself up by pullies to an insensibility of suffering , and , at the same time , to give the lie to his own experience , by saying he suffers not , what he knows he feels . True philosophy is certainly of a more pliant nature , and more accommodated to human use ; Homo sum , humani \u00e0 me nihil alienum puto . A wise man will never attempt an impossibility ; and such it is to strain himself beyond the nature of his being , either to become a deity , by being above suffering , or to debase himself into a stock or stone , by pretending not to feel it . To find in ourselves the weaknesses and imperfections of our wretched kind , is surely the most reasonable step we can make towards the compassion of our fellow-creatures . I could give examples of this kind in the second Atticus . In every turn of state , without meddling on either side , he has always been favourable and assisting to opprest merit . The praises which were given by a great poet to the late queen-mother , on her rebuilding Somerset Palace , one part of which was fronting to the mean houses on the other side of the water , are as justly his : For the distrest and the afflicted lie Most in his thoughts , and always in his eyeNeither has he so far forgotten a poor inhabitant of his suburbs , whose best prospect is on the garden of Leicester House , but that more than once he has been offering him his patronage , to reconcile him to a world , of which his misfortunes have made him wearyThere is another Sidney still remaining , though there can never be another Spenser to deserve the favour . But one Sidney gave his patronage to the applications of a poet ; the other offered it unasked . Thus , whether as a second Atticus , or a second Sir Philip Sidney , the latter in all respects will not have the worse of the comparison ; and if he will take up with the second place , the world will not so far flatter his modesty , as to seat him there , unless it be out of a deference of manners , that he may place himself where he pleases at his own table . I may therefore safely conclude , that he , who , by the consent of all men , bears so eminent a character , will out of his inborn nobleness forgive the presumption of this address . It is an unfinished picture , I confess , but the lines and features are so like , that it cannot be mistaken for any other ; and without writing any name under it , every beholder must cry out , at first sight ,\u2014 this was designed for Atticus ; but the bad artist has cast too much of him into shades . But I have this excuse , that even the greatest masters commonly fall short of the best faces . They may flatter an indifferent beauty ; but the excellencies of nature can have no right done to them ; for there both the pencil and pen are overcome by the dignity of the subject ; as our admirable Waller has expressed it , The heroe 's race transcends the poet 's thought . There are few in any age who can bear the load of a dedication ; for where praise is undeserved , it is satire ; though satire on folly is now no longer a scandal to any one person , where a whole age is dipt together . Yet I had rather undertake a multitude one way , than a single Atticus the other ; for it is easier to descend than it is to climb . I should have gone ashamed out of the world , if I had not at least attempted this address , which I have long thought owing : and if I had never attempted , I might have been vain enough to think I might have succeeded in it . Now I have made the experiment , and have failed through my unworthiness , I may rest satisfied , that either the adventure is not to be atchieved , or that it is reserved for some other hand . Be pleased , therefore , since the family of the Attici is and ought to be above the common forms of concluding letters , that I may take my leave in the words of Cicero to the first of them : Me , O Pomponi , vald\u00e8 p\u00e6nitet vivere : tant\u00f9m te oro , ut quoniam me ipse semper am\u00e0sti , ut eodem amore sis ; ego nimirum idem sum . Inimici mei mea mihi non meipsum ademerunt . Cura , Attice , ut valeas .", "The Chacon is supposed by Sir John Hawkins to be of Moorish or Saracenic origin . \u201c The characteristic of the Chacone is a bass , or ground , consisting of four measures , wherein three crotchets make the bar , and the repetition thereof with variations in the several parts , from the beginning to the end of the air , which in respect of its length , has no limit but the discretion of the composer . The whole of the twelfth sonata of the second opera of Corelli is a Chacone . \u201d Hist . of Music , vol . iv . p. 388 . There is also , I am informed , a very celebrated Chacon composed by Jomelli .", "Dryden and Shadwell had once been friends . In the preface to \u201c The Humourists , \u201d acted , according to Mr Malone , in 1676 , Shadwell thus mentions his great contemporary : \u201c And here I must make a little digression , and take liberty to dissent from my particular friend , for whom I have a very great respect , and whose writings I extremely admire ; and , though I will not say , his is the best way of writing , yet , I am sure his manner of writing is much the best that ever was . And I may say of him , as was said of a celebrated poet , Cui unquam poetarum magis proprium fuit subito astro incalescere ? Quis ubi incaluit , fortius et f\u00e6clicius debacchatur ? His verse is smoother and deeper , his thoughts more quick and surprising , his raptures more mettled and higher , and he has more of that in his writings , which Plato calls s\u00f4phrona manian than any other heroic poet . And those who shall go about to imitate him , will be found to flutter and make a noise , but never to rise . \u201d Such a compliment , from a rival dramatist , could only have been extracted by previous good offices and kindly countenance . Accordingly we find , that Dryden , in 1678-9 , wrote a prologue to Shadwell 's play , of \u201c The True Widow . \u201d", "Alluding to the fate of Stephen College , the Protestant joiner ; a meddling , pragmatical fellow , who put himself so far forward in the disputes at Oxford , as to draw down the vengeance of the court . He was very harshly treated during his trial ; and though in the toils , and deprived of all assistance , defended himself with right English manliness . He was charged with the ballad on page 6. and with coming to Oxford armed to attack the guards . He said he did not deny he had pistols in his holsters at Oxford ; to which Jefferies answered , indecently , but not unaptly , he \u201c thought a chissel might have been more proper for a joiner . \u201d Poor College was executed ; a vengeance unworthy of the king , who might have apostrophised him as Hamlet does Polonius : Thou wretched , rash , intruding fool , farewell ; I took thee for thy betters \u2014 take thy fortune .

When heaven made man , to show the work divine , Truth was his image , stamped upon the coin : And when a king is to a God refined , On all he says and does he stamps his mind : This proves a soul without alloy , and pure ; Kings , like their gold , should every touch endure . To dare in fields is valour ; but how few Dare be so throughly valiant ,\u2014 to be true ! The name of great , let other kings affect : He 's great indeed , the prince that is direct . His subjects know him now , and trust him more Than all their kings , and all their laws before . What safety could their public acts afford ? Those he can break ; but cannot break his word . So great a trust to him alone was due ; Well have they trusted whom so well they knew . The saint , who walked on waves , securely trod , While he believed the beck'ning of his God ; But when his faith no longer bore him out , Began to sink , as he began to doubt . Let us our native character maintain ; \u2018 Tis of our growth , to be sincerely plain . To excel in truth we loyally may strive , Set privilege against prerogative : He plights his faith , and we believe him just ; His honour is to promise , ours to trust .

From this Epilogue we learn , what is confirmed by many proofs elsewhere , that the attribute for which James desired to be distinguished and praised , was that of openness of purpose , and stern undeviating inflexibility of conduct . He scorned to disguise his designs , either upon the religion or the constitution of his country . He forgot that it was only the temporising concessions of his brother which secured his way to the throne , when his exclusion , or a civil war , seemed the only alternatives . His brother was the reed , which bent before the whirlwind , and recovered its erect posture when it had passed away ; and James , the inflexible oak , which the first tempest rooted up for ever . DON SEBASTIAN . A TRAGEDY . \u2014 Nec tarda senectus Debilitat vires animi , mutatque vigorem . VIRG . DON SEBASTIAN . The following tragedy is founded upon the adventures supposed to have befallen Sebastian , king of Portugal , after the fatal battle of Alcazar . The reader may be briefly reminded of the memorable expedition of that gallant monarch to Africa , to signalize , against the Moors , his chivalry as a warrior , and his faith as a Christian . The ostensible pretext of invasion was the cause of Muly Mahomet , son of Abdalla , emperor of Morocco ; upon whose death , his brother , Muly Moluch , had seized the crown , and driven his nephew into exile . The armies joined battle near Alcazar . The Portuguese , far inferior in number to the Moors , displayed the most desperate valour , and had nearly won the day , when Muly Moluch , who , though almost dying , was present on the field in a litter , fired with shame and indignation , threw himself on horseback , rallied his troops , renewed the combat , and , being carried back to his litter , immediately expired , with his finger placed on his lips , to impress on the chiefs , who surrounded him , the necessity of concealing his death . The Moors , rallied by their sovereign 's dying exertion , surrounded , and totally routed , the army of Sebastian . Mahomet , the competitor for the throne of Morocco , was drowned in passing a river in his flight , and Sebastian , as his body was never found , probably perished in the same manner . But where the region of historical certainty ends , that of romantic tradition commences . The Portuguese , to whom the memory of their warlike sovereign was deservedly dear , grasped at the feeble hope which the uncertainty of his fate afforded , and long , with vain fondness , expected the return of Sebastian , to free them from the yoke of Spain . This mysterious termination of a hero 's career , as it gave rise to various political intrigues ,early afforded a subject for exercising the fancy of the dramatist and romance writer . \u201c The Battle of Alcazar\" is known to the collectors of old plays ; a ballad on the same subject is reprinted in Evans 's collection ; and our author mentions a French novel on the adventures of Don Sebastian , to which Langbaine also refers . The situation of Dryden , after the Revolution , was so delicate as to require great caution and attention , both in his choice of a subject , and his mode of treating it . His distressed circumstances and lessened income compelled him to come before the public as an author ; while the odium attached to the proselyte of a hated religion , and the partizan of a depressed faction , was likely , upon the slightest pretext , to transfer itself from the person of the poet to the labours on which his support depended . He was , therefore , not only obliged to chuse a theme , which had no offence in it , and to treat it in a manner which could not admit of misconstruction , but also so to exert the full force of his talents , as , by the conspicuous pre-eminence of his genius , to bribe prejudice and silence calumny . An observing reader will accordingly discover , throughout the following tragedy , symptoms of minute finishing , and marks of accurate attention , which , in our author 's better days , he deigned not to bestow upon productions , to which his name alone was then sufficient to give weight and privilege . His choice of a subject was singularly happy : the name of Sebastian awaked historical recollections and associations , favourable to the character of his hero ; while the dark uncertainty of his fate removed all possibility of shocking the audience by glaring offence against the majesty of historical truth . The subject has , therefore , all the advantages of a historical play , without the detects , which either a rigid coincidence with history , or a violent contradiction of known truth , seldom fail to bring along with them . Dryden appears from his preface to have been fully sensible of this ; and he has not lost the advantage of a happy subject by treating it with the carelessness he sometimes allowed himself to indulge . The characters in \u201c Don Sebastian \u201d are contrasted with singular ability and judgment . Sebastian , high-spirited and fiery ; the soul of royal and military honour ; the soldier and the king ; almost embodies the idea which the reader forms at the first mention of his name . Dorax , to whom he is so admirable a contrast , is one of those characters whom the strong hand of adversity has wrested from their natural bias ; and perhaps no equally vivid picture can be found , of a subject so awfully interesting . Born with a strong tendency to all that was honourable and virtuous , the very excess of his virtues became vice , when his own ill fate , and Sebastian 's injustice , had driven him into exile . By comparing , as Dryden has requested , the character of Dorax , in the fifth act , with that he maintains in the former part of the play , the difference may be traced betwixt his natural virtues , and the vices engrafted on them by headlong passion and embittering calamity . There is no inconsistence in the change which takes place after his scene with Sebastian ; as was objected by those , whom the poet justly terms , \u201c the more ignorant sort of creatures . \u201d It is the same picture in a new light ; the same ocean in tempest and in calm ; the same traveller , whom sunshine has induced to abandon his cloak , which the storm only forced him to wrap more closely around him . The principal failing of Dorax is the excess of pride , which renders each supposed wound to his honour more venomously acute ; yet he is not devoid of gentler affections , though even in indulging these the hardness of his character is conspicuous . He loves Violante , but that is a far subordinate feeling to his affection for Sebastian . Indeed , his love appears so inferior to his loyal devotion to his king , that , unless to gratify the taste of the age , I see little reason for its being introduced at all . It is obvious he was much more jealous of the regard of his sovereign , than of his mistress ; he never mentions Violante till the scene of explanation with Sebastian ; and he appears hardly to have retained a more painful recollection of his disappointment in that particular , than of the general neglect and disgrace he had sustained at the court of Lisbon . The last stage of a virtuous heart , corroded into evil by wounded pride , has been never more forcibly displayed than in the character of Dorax . When once induced to take the fatal step which degraded him in his own eyes , all his good affections seem to be converted into poison . The religion , which displays itself in the fifth act in his arguments against suicide , had , in his efforts to justify his apostacy , or at least to render it a matter of no moment , been exchanged for sentiments approaching , perhaps to atheism , certainly to total scepticism . His passion for Violante is changed into contempt and hatred for her sex , which he expresses in the coarsest terms . His feelings of generosity , and even of humanity , are drowned in the gloomy and stern misanthropy , which has its source in the self-discontent that endeavours to wreak itself upon others . This may be illustrated by his unfeeling behaviour , while Alvarez and Antonio , well known to him in former days , approach , and draw the deadly lot , which ratifies their fate . No yielding of compassion , no recollection of former friendship , has power to alter the cold and sardonic sarcasm with which he sketches their characters , and marks their deportment in that awful moment . Finally , the zealous attachment of Alonzo for his king , which , in its original expression , partakes of absolute devotion , is changed , by the circumstances of Dorax , into an irritated and frantic jealousy , which he mistakes for hatred ; and which , in pursuing the destruction of its object , is almost more inveterate than hatred itself . Nothing has survived of the original Alonzo at the opening of the piece , except the gigantic passion which has caused his ruin . This character is drawn on a large scale , and in a heroic proportion ; but it is so true to nature , that many readers must have lamented , even within the circle of domestic acquaintance , instances of feelings hardened , and virtues perverted , where a high spirit has sustained severe and unjust neglect and disgrace . The whole demeanour of this exquisite character suits the original sketch . From \u201c the long stride and sullen port , \u201d by which Benducar distinguishes him at a distance , to the sullen stubbornness with which he obeys , or the haughty contempt with which he resists , the commands of the peremptory tyrant under whom he had taken service , all announce the untamed pride which had robbed Dorax of virtue , and which yet , when Benducar would seduce him into a conspiracy , and in his conduct towards Sebastian , assumes the port and dignity of virtue herself . In all his conduct and bearing , there is that mixed feeling and impulse , which constitutes the real spring of human action . The true motive of Alonzo in saving Sebastian , is not purely that of honourable hatred , which he proposes to himself ; for to himself every man endeavours to appear consistent , and readily find arguments to prove to himself that he is so . Neither is his conduct to be ascribed altogether to the gentler feelings of loyal and friendly affection , relenting at the sight of his sovereign 's ruin , and impending death . It is the result of a mixture of these opposite sensations , clashing against each other like two rivers at their conflux , yet urging their united course down the same channel . Actuated by a mixture of these feelings , Dorax meets Sebastian ; and the art of the poet is displayed in that admirable scene , by suggesting a natural motive to justify to the injured subject himself the change of the course of his feelings . As his jealousy of Sebastian 's favour , and resentment of his unjust neglect , was chiefly founded on the avowed preference which the king had given to Henriquez , the opportune mention of his rival 's death , by removing the cause of that jealousy , gives the renegade an apology to his own pride , for throwing himself at the feet of that very sovereign , whom a moment before he was determined to force to combat . They are little acquainted with human passions , at least have only witnessed their operations among men of common minds , who doubt , that at the height of their very spring-tide , they are often most susceptible of sudden changes ; revolutions , which seem to those who have not remarked how nearly the most opposite feelings are allied and united , the most extravagant and unaccountable . Muly Moluch is an admirable specimen of that very frequent theatrical character ,\u2014 a stage tyrant . He is fierce and boisterous enough to be sufficiently terrible and odious , and that without much rant , considering he is an infidel Soldan , who , from the ancient deportment of Mahomed and Termagaunt , as they appeared in the old Mysteries , might claim a prescriptive right to tear a passion to tatters . Besides , the Moorish emperor has fine glances of savage generosity , and that free , unconstrained , and almost noble openness , the only good quality , perhaps , which a consciousness of unbounded power may encourage in a mind so firm as not to be totally depraved by it . The character of Muly Moluch , like that of Morat , in \u201c Aureng-Zebe , \u201d to which it bears a strong resemblance , was admirably represented by Kynaston ; who had , says Cibber , \u201c a fierce lion-like majesty in his port and utterance , that gave the spectator a kind of trembling admiration . \u201d It is enough to say of Benducar , that the cool , fawning , intriguing , and unprincipled statesman , is fully developed in his whole conduct ; and of Alvarez , that the little he has to say and do , is so said and done , as not to disgrace his common-place character of the possessor of the secret on which the plot depends ; for it may be casually observed , that the depositary of such a clew to the catastrophe , though of the last importance to the plot , is seldom himself of any interest whatever . The haughty and high-spirited Almeyda is designed by the author as the counterpart of Sebastian . She breaks out with the same violence , I had almost said fury , and frequently discovers a sort of kindred sentiment , intended to prepare the reader for the unfortunate discovery , that she is the sister of the Portuguese monarch . Of the diction , Dr Johnson has said , with meagre commendation , that it has \u201c some sentiments which leave a strong impression , \u201d and \u201c others of excellence , universally acknowledged . \u201d This , even when the admiration of the scene betwixt Dorax and Sebastian has been sanctioned by that great critic , seems scanty applause for the chef d'oeuvre of Dryden 's dramatic works . The reader will be disposed to look for more unqualified praise , when such a poet was induced , by every pressing consideration , to combine , in one effort , the powers of his mighty genius , and the fruits of his long theatrical experience : Accordingly , Shakespeare laid aside , it will be perhaps difficult to point out a play containing more animatory incident , impassioned language , and beautiful description , than \u201c Don Sebastian . \u201d Of the former , the scene betwixt Dorax and the king , had it been the only one ever Dryden wrote , would have been sufficient to insure his immortality . There is not ,\u2014 no , perhaps , not even in Shakespeare ,\u2014 an instance where the chord , which the poet designed should vibrate , is more happily struck ; strains there are of a higher mood , but not more correctly true ; in evidence of which , we have known those , whom distresses of a gentler nature were unable to move , feel their stubborn feelings roused and melted by the injured pride and deep repentance of Dorax . The burst of anguish with which he answers the stern taunt of Sebastian , is one of those rare , but natural instances , in which high-toned passion assumes a figurative language , because all that is familiar seems inadequate to express its feelings :"]}, "act_index": 28, "play_index": 28}, {"data": {"773": ["\u201c All crowned heads by poetical right are heroes .

A queste parole il Duca con l \u2019 istessa sommissione , che aveva fatto alla Reina , ma con parole pi\u00f9 ritenute , rispose . Ch \u2019 Egli era venuto a mettersi nelle braccia della giustitia di Sua Maest\u00e0 , per iscolparsi delle calunnie , che gli erano apposte da \u2019 suoi nemici , e che nondimeno non sarebbe venuto , quando gli fosse stato detto chiaramente , che Sua Maest\u00e0 comandata , che non venisse .

Monseignor di Bellieure si feceinnanzi , e volle render conto dell \u2019 ambasciata sua ; ma nel principio del parlare , il Re l \u2019 interruppe , dicendogli , che bastava , e rivolto al Duca di Guisa disse ; che non sapeva , ch \u2019 egii fosse stato calunniato da persona alcuna , ma che la sua innocenza sarebbe apparsa chiara , quando dalla sua venuta non fosse nata alcuna novit\u00e0 , e interrotta la quiete del governo , come si prevedeva . La Reina pratica della natura del Re , conoscendolo dalla faccia inclinato a qualche gagliarda risoluzione , lo tir\u00f2 da parte , e gli disse in sostanza quel che aveva veduto della concorrenza del popolo , e che non pensasse a deliberazioni precipitose , perch\u00e8 non era tempo . Il medesimo soggiunse la Duchessa d \u2019 Uzes , che gli era vicina , e il Duca di Guisa osservando attentamente ogni minuzia , come vide questa fluttazione , per non dar tempo al Re di deliberare , si finse stracco dal viaggio , e licenziandosi brevemente da lui , accompagnato dall \u2019 istessa frequenza di popolo , ma da niuno di quelli della corte , si ritir\u00f2 nella strada di Sant \u2019 Antonio alle sue case . \u201d Lib . ix . ]"]}, "act_index": 28, "play_index": 28}, {"data": {"776": ["Come sparvier tra ramo e ramo aspetta ;", "Quivi stetton coloro alla veletta ,", "E che e \u2019 batessin tutto il giorno l \u2019 ali ,", "Quando vedrem , che tu farai macello .", "Il Morgante Maggiore , Canto XXVI .

This is set forth with some humour in a political pamphlet of the day , called , \u201c A Dialogue betwixt Sam , the ferryman of Datchet , Will , a waterman of London , and Tom , a bargeman of Oxford ; \u201d upon the king 's calling a parliament to meet at Oxford , London , 1681 . \u201c As to their own members , they turned them out , and took others in at their will and pleasure ; and if they made any fault , they expelled them ; and wherever any stood in competition for any town , him they knew would give his vote along with them was admitted , right or wrong . And then they terrified all the sheriffs , mayors , and bailiffs in the kingdom , besides abundance of gentlemen and other honest countrymen . For , on the least complaint of any man 's misdemeanour , or information from any member , immediately a serjeant at arms was sent for them , and so much a mile and hour paid , and down on their marrowbones to their worships , and a sound scolding from Mr Speaker , or else to the Tower or Gatehouse they went . The king , God bless him , never took a quarter of that state on him they did ... It was brought to that pass , that two footboys , boxing one day in the Palace-yard , he that was beaten proved to belong to a member , and told the other boy , if he knew his master , he would cause him to be sent for in custody , for keeping such a rogue as he was , that had committed a breach of privilege in beating a member 's servant . The boy replied , if it would do him any kindness , he would beat him again , and tell him his master 's name into the bargain ; and would lay him a crown , that , though his master should bid the Speaker , and all the House of Commons , kiss , & c. they durst not send a serjeant at arms for him . The beaten boy , much nettled at his speech , laid down his money , as the other did : now , said the boy , my master is the king of France , and I am come over with some of his servants to fetch horses out of England ; go , bid thy master and the House of Commons send a serjeant at arms to fetch him over .\u2014 Sam . Before my heart it was a good answer ; I hope he won his monies ?\u2014 Will . So he did ; but it was put into a waterman 's hands , and when it was demanded , says the beaten boy , Sirrah , give it him , if you dare ; if his master be the king of France , I 'll make you answer it before the House of Commons . The waterman durst do no other , but gave either their own monies . There 's no contending with parliament men , or parliament men 's men , nor boys . \u201d Some occasion was given for these reproaches by the summary and arbitrary commitment of many individuals , who had addressed the king in terms expressing their abhorrence of the vehement petitions presented by the other party for the sitting of parliament , and were thence distinguished by the name of Abhorrers . This course was ended by the sturdy resistance of one Stowell , who had , as foreman of the grand jury at Exeter , presented an abhorring address to the king . A serjeant at arms having been sent to apprehend him , he refused to submit , and bid the officer take his course , adding , he knew no law which made him accountable for what he did as a grand juryman .

But I will not dwell on the beauties of this scene . If any one is incapable of relishing it , he may safely conclude , that nature has not merely denied him that rare gift , poetical taste , but common powers of comprehending the ordinary feelings of humanity . The love scene , betwixt Sebastian and Almeyda , is more purely conceived , and expressed with more reference to sentiment , than is common with our author . The description which Dorax gives of Sebastian , before his appearance , coming from a mortal enemy , at least from one whose altered love was as envenomed as hatred , is a grand preparation for the appearance of the hero . In many of the slighter descriptive passages , we recognize the poet by those minute touches , which a mind susceptible of poetic feeling is alone capable of bringing out . The approach of the emperor , while the conspirators are caballing , is announced by Orchan , with these picturesque circumstances : I see the blaze of torches from afar , And hear the trampling of thick-beating feet \u2014 This way they move .\u2014 The following account , given by the slave sent to observe what passed in the castle of Dorax , believed to be dead , or dying , is equally striking :", "Stand off , sycophant ,", "No part of government , but lords of anarchy ,", "Hold , and let me think .", "Of all court service , learn the common lot ,\u2014", "And bid us pass for men .", "That rolls within my breast .", "But shed from nature , like a kindly shower :", "By manly vengeance to redeem my fame ;", "As that I served thee fifteen hard campaigns ,", "So horrid , in the face of men and angels ,", "You marked not what I told you .", "Expect an answer worthy of that message .", "Because it would oblige me to forgiveness .", "Was the propitious error of my fate ,", "And keep infection distant .", "True , I rebelled : But when did I betray ?\u2014", "I said so , if you lived .", "On palaces returns .
