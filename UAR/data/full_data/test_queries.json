That is , does it always create emotion in an onlooker ? No . It goes for naught unless it rouses his interest . Of itself , or because of the presentation given it by the dramatist , it must rouse in the onlooker an emotional response . A boy seeing \u201c Crazy Mary \u201d stalking the street in bedizened finery and bowing right and left , may see nothing interesting in her . More probably her actions will move him to jeer and jibe at her . Let some spectator , however , tell the boy of the tragedy in Crazy Mary 's younger life which left her unbalanced , and , if he has any right feeling , the boy 's attitude will begin to change . He may even give over the jeering he has begun . Reveal to him exactly what is passing in the crazed mind of the woman , and his mere interest will probably turn to sympathy . Characterization , preceding and accompanying action , creates sympathy or repulsion for the figure or figures involved . This sympathy or repulsion in turn converts mere interest into emotional response of the keenest kind . Though physical action is undoubtedly fundamental in drama , no higher form than crude melodrama or crude farce can develop till characterization appears to explain and interpret action . The following extracts from Robertson 's Home show physical action , silly it is true , yet developing characterization by illustrative action .

C . for a stroll . Mr. and Mrs. Jones discuss them , and decide that they are very \u201c nice \u201d people . During their talk it develops that while Mr. Brede had been telling Mr. Jones that Mrs. Brede had been in this country when he climbed the Matterhorn , Mrs. Brede had informed Mrs. Jones that her husband had left her at Geneva and afterwards taken her to Basle , where their first child was born . At this point Mrs. Halkit comes from the house . She censures Mrs. Brede for not knowing how to care for her husband and children and it comes out that Mrs. Brede has told Mrs. Halkit that they have two children who have been left with her aunt , whereas Mr. Brede has told Mr. Jones that they have three children at present under the care of his mother-in-law . Enter Major Halkit from the house . He criticises Mr. Brede , who purports to be looking for a business opening , for his failure to take a fine chance the Major has pointed out to him . The party come to the conclusion that there is something queer about the couple and are about to call Jacobus when he appears , coming from the left . Before any of the boarders have a chance to speak , Jacobus asks some question about the numbering of streets in New York and the fact is brought out that Mr. Brede told Mrs. Jacobus , when he was engaging the room , that he lived at number thirty-four of his street , and that the day before Mrs. Brede had informed Mrs. Jacobus that their number was thirty-five .... A reader struggling through the paragraphs of this scenario finds very little that is dramatic because the dramatic values the writer feels in his sentences cannot be the reader 's till he learns that Mr. and Mrs. Brede are a newly married couple who wish to conceal the fact . Re-read the quotation with that in mind and all confusion disappears . On the other hand , it is not always easy to convey needed preliminary exposition interestingly . When much is needed , there is always danger that the opening of the scenario will be talky and referential rather than definite and full of dramatic action . The following is by no means as bad an example as might be found of a slow opening caused by need for much historical exposition , but it certainly lacks gripping action : SCENARIO OF CONISTON When the curtain is raised , Millicent Skinner is working about ; a second later Chester Perkins comes slinking in , looking back as though pursued by the Evil One , and close on his heels , another local politician , Mr. Dodd , of the Brampton prudential school committee , enters with the same stealthy and harassed air . Millicent twits them with having run away from Bijah Bixby who is at Jonah Winch 's store . They deny that they are afraid of Bije or any one . It is brought out in a sentence or two that Jethro Bass , Cynthia and Ephraim Prescott are away on their Washington trip , and that Bijah , knowing of Jethro 's absence , is not likely to come here , which is why the two men have chosen the yard for a refuge ; as they have been planning petty treason against the political control of the town by Jethro Bass . Millicent laughs at them and goes in the house . Mr. Dodd and Chester recover their swagger and begin to discuss Bijah and his sneaking ways . Bob Worthington enters , goes to the porch and calls Millicent . She responds from a nearby window . He enquires when she expects Cynthia to return . She tells him they will be here today . Bob announces that he will return , a little later , and goes out . Chester and Dodd discuss Bob 's attention to Cynthia and how furious the elder Worthington will be if his son marries the ward of Jethro Bass . Then they drift back to their first topic and are soon absorbed in their wordy revolt against Jethro Bass and Bijah .", "Macready 's Bentevole is very fine in its kind . It is natural , easy , and forcible . Indeed , we suspect some parts of it were too natural , that is , that Mr. Macready thought too much of what his feelings might dictate in such circumstances , rather than of what the circumstances must have dictated to him to do . We allude particularly to the half significant , half hysterical laugh and distorted jocular leer , with his eyes towards the persons accusing him of the murder , when the evidence of his guilt comes out . Either the author did not intend him to behave in this manner , or he must have made the other parties on the stage interrupt him as a self-convicted criminal .Stevenson clearly recognized this truth : I have had a heavy case of conscience of the same kind about my Braxfield story . Braxfield \u2014 only his name is Hermiston \u2014 has a son who is condemned to death ; plainly there is a fine tempting fitness about this ; and I meant he was to hang . But now , on considering my minor characters , I saw there were five people who would \u2014 in a sense who must \u2014 break prison and attempt his rescue . They are capable , hardy folks , too , who might very well succeed . Why should they not , then ? Why should not young Hermiston escape clear out of the country ? and be happy if he could with his \u2014 But soft ! I will betray my secret or my heroine .When a scene clogs , do n't hold the pen waiting for the impulse to write : do n't try to write at all . Study the situation , not for itself , but for the people in it . \u201c The Dramatist who depends his characters to his plot , \u201d says Mr. Galsworthy , worthy , \u201c instead of his plot to his characters , ought himself to be depended . \u201dIf a thorough knowledge of the characters in the particular situation does not bring a solution , study them as the scene relates itself to what must precede in characterization . More than once a dramatist has found that he could not compose some scene satisfactorily till he had written carefully the previous history of the important character or characters . The detailed knowledge thus gained revealed whether or not the characters could enter the desired situation , and if so , how . Pailleron , author of Le Monde ou l'on s'ennuie declared that , in his early drafts , he always had three or four times the material in regard to his dramatis personae ultimately used by him . Intimate knowledge of his characters is the only safe foundation for the ambitious playwright . It is well-nigh useless to ask managers and actors to pass finally on a mere statement of a situation or group of situations , without characterization . All they can say is : \u201c Bring me this again as an amplified scenario , or a play , which shows me to what extent the people you have in mind give freshness of interest to this story , which has been used again and again in the drama of different nations , and I will tell you what I will do for you . \u201d Reduce any dramatic masterpiece to simple statement of its plot and the story will seem so trite as hardly to be worth dramatization . For instance : a man of jealous nature , passionately in love with his young wife , is made by the lies and trickery of a friend to believe that his wife has been intriguing with another of his friends . The fact is that the calumniator slanders because he thinks his abilities have not been properly recognized by the husband and he has been repulsed by the wife . In a fury of jealousy the husband kills his innocent wife and then himself . That might be recognized as the story of any one of fifty French , German , Italian , English , or American plays of the last hundred years . It is , of course , the story of Othello \u2014 a masterpiece because Shakespeare knew Othello , Iago , Desdemona , and Cassio so intimately that by their interplay of character upon character they shape every scene perfectly . In other words , though a striking dramatic situation is undoubtedly dramatic treasure trove , whether it can be developed into anything fresh and contributive depends on a careful study of the people involved . What must they be to give rise to such a situation \u2014 not each by himself , but when brought together under the conditions of the scene ? Even if a writer knows this , he must work backward into the earlier history of his people before he can either move through the particular scene or go forward into other scenes which should properly result from it . Far too often plays are planned in this way . A writer thinks of some setting that will permit him a large amount of local color \u2014 a barroom , a dance hall , the wharf of an incoming ocean liner . Recognizing or not that most of this local color is unessential to the real action of the play , he does see that one or two incidents which are necessary and striking may be set against this background . Knowing broadly , how he wants to treat the scene , instead of studying the main and minor characters in it till he knows them so intimately that he can select from a larger amount of material than he can possibly use , he moves , not where the characters lead him , but whither , vi et armis , he can drive them . Rarely to him will come the delightful dilemma , so commonly experienced by the dramatist who really cares for character , when he must choose between what he was going to do and the scene as developed by the creatures of his imagination who , as they become real , take the scene away from him and shape it to vastly richer results .When the dramatist interested only in situation shapes the acts preceding his most important scene , he searches simply for conditions of character which will permit this important scene to follow . Result : earlier acts , largely of exposition and talk , or of illustrative action slight and unconvincing because characters forced into a crucial situation can hardly reveal how they brought themselves to it . There is no middle way for the dramatist who seeks truth in characterization . Given a situation , either it must grow naturally out of the characters in it , or the people originally in the mind of the author must be remodeled till they fit naturally into the situation . In the latter case , all that precedes and follows the central situation must be re-worked , not as the dramatist may wish , but as the remodeled characters permit . A critic met a well-known dramatist on the Strand . The dramatist looked worried . \u201c What 's the matter , \u201d queried the critic , \u201c anything gone wrong ? \u201d \u201c Yes . You remember the play I told you about , and that splendid situation for my heroine ? \u201d \u201c Yes . Well ? \u201d \u201c Well ! She wo n't go into it , confound her , do the best I can . \u201d \u201c Why make her ? \u201d \u201c Why ? Because if I do n't there 's an end to that splendid situation . \u201d \u201c Well ? \u201d \u201c Oh , that 's just why I 'm bothered . I do n't want to give in , I do n't want to lose that situation ; but she 's right , of course she 's right , and the trouble is I know I 've got to yield . \u201d At first sight the problem may seem different in an historical play , for here a writer is not creating incident but is often baffled by the amount of material from which he must select ,\u2014 happenings that seem equally dramatic , speeches that cry out to be transferred to the stage , and delightful bits of illustrative action . Yet , whether his underlying purpose is to convey an idea , depict a character , or tell a story , how can he decide which bits among his material make the best illustrative action before he has minutely studied the important figures ? Above all others , the dramatist working with history is subject to the principles of characterization already laid down . Lessing stated the whole case succinctly : Only if he chooses other and even opposed characters to the historical , he should refrain from using historical names , and rather credit totally unknown personages with well-known facts than invent characters to well-known personages . The one mode enlarges our knowledge or seems to enlarge it and is thus agreeable . The other contradicts the knowledge that we already possess and is thus unpleasant . We regard the facts as something accidental , as something that may be common to many persons ; the characters we regard as something individual and intrinsic . The poet may take any liberties he likes with the former so long as he does not put the facts into contradiction with the characters ; the characters he may place in full light but he may not change them , the smallest change seems to destroy their individuality and to substitute in their place other persons , false persons , who have usurped strange names and pretend to be what they are not .There is , however , a contrasting danger to insufficient characterization . Any one profoundly interested in character may easily fill a scene with delicate touches which nevertheless swell the play to undue length . When careful examination of a play which is too long makes obvious that no act or scene can be spared in whole or in part , and that the dialogue is nowhere wordy or redundant , watch the best characterized scenes to discover whether something has not been conveyed by two strokes rather than one . If so , choose the better . Watch the scenes also lest delicate and sure touches of characterization may have been included which , delightful though they be , are not absolutely necessary to our understanding of the character . If so , select what most swiftly yet clearly gives the needed information . Over-detail in characterization is the reason why certain modern plays have sagged , or hitched their way to a conclusion , instead of producing the effect desired by the author . For ultimate convincingness no play can rise above the level of its characterization . The playwright who works for only momentary success may doubtless depend upon the onward rush of events , in a play of strong emotion , to blind his audience to lack of motivation in his characters . John Fletcher is the great leader of these opportunists of the theatre . Evadne , in The Maid 's Tragedy ,killing the King , is a very different woman from the Evadne who gladly became his mistress . Nor are the reproaches and exhortations of her brother Melantius powerful enough to change a woman of her character so swiftly and completely . An audience , absorbed in the emotion of the moment , may overlook such faults of characterization in the theatre . As it reviews the play in calmer mood , however , it ranks it , no matter how poetic as a whole or how well characterized in particular scenes , not as a drama which interprets life , but as mere entertainment . Even perfect characterization of some figures , when the chief are mere puppets , cannot make us accept the play as more than pure fiction . In Thomas Heywood 's A Woman Killed with Kindness and English Traveler ,if the erring wives and their lovers were only as well characterized as the fine-spirited husbands , the servants , and youths like Young Geraldine , the plays might hold the stage today . Doubtless the actor 's art in the days of Elizabeth and James gave to villains like Wendoll and women like Mrs. Frankford enough verisimilitude to make the plays far more convincing than they are in the reading . But try as we may , we cannot understand from the text either of these characters . Their motivation is totally inadequate ; that is , their conduct seems not to grow out of their characters . Rather , they are the creatures of any situation into which the dramatist wishes to thrust them . This need of motivation may be fundamental , that is , the characters may seem to an audience unconvincing from the start ; or may be evident in some insufficiently explained change , transition in character ; or may appear only in the last scene of the play , where characters hitherto consistent are made to act in a way which seems to the audience improbable . When Nathaniel Rowe produced his Ambitious Stepmother in 1700 , Charles Gildon bitterly attacked it as unconvincing in its very fundamentals . Mirza is indeed a Person of a peculiar Taste ; for a Cunning Man to own himself a Rogue to the Man he shou 'd keep in ignorance , and whom he was to work to his ends , argues little pretence to that Name ; but he laughs at Honesty , and professes himself a Knave to one he wou 'd have honest to him .... In the second Act , he talks of Memnon 's having recourse to Arms , of which Power we have not the least Word in the first : All that we know is , that he returns from Banishment on a day of Jubilee , when all was Safe and Free ....For similar reasons , Mr. Eaton criticises unfavorably The Fighting Hope : One of the bestexamples of false ethics in such a play is furnished by The Fighting Hope , produced by Mr. Belasco in the Autumn of 1908 , and acted by Miss Blanche Bates . In this play a man , Granger , has been jailed , his wife and the world believe for another man 's crime . The other man , Burton Temple , is president of the bank Granger has been convicted of robbing . A district attorney , hot after men higher up , is about to reopen the case . It begins to look bad for Temple . Mrs. Granger , disguised as a stenographer , goes to his house to secure evidence against him . What she secures is a letter proving that not he , but her husband , was after all the criminal . Of course this letter is a knockout blow for her . She realizes that the \u201c father of her boys \u201d is a thief , that the man she would send to jailis innocent . Still , in her first shock , her instinct to protect the \u201c father of her boys \u201d persists , and she burns the letter . So far , so good , but Mrs. Granger is represented as a woman of fine instincts and character . That she should persist in cooler blood in her false and immoral supposition that her boys \u2019 name will be protected or their happiness preserved \u2014 to say nothing of her own \u2014 by the guilt of two parents instead of one , is hard to believe . Yet that is exactly what the play asks you to believe , and it asks you to assume that here is a true dilemma . A babbling old housekeeper , whose chief use in the house seems to be to help the plot along , after the manner of stage servants , tells Mrs. Granger that she must not atone for her act by giving honest testimony in court , that of course she must let an innocent man go to jail , to \u201c save her boys \u2019 name . \u201d It would be much more sensible should Mrs. Granger here strike the immoral old lady , instead of saving her blows for her cur of a husband , in the last act , who , after all , was the \u201c father of her boys . \u201d But she listens to her . She appears actually in doubt not only as to which course she will pursue , but which she should pursue . She is intended by the dramatist as a pitiable object because on the one hand she feels it right to save an innocent man, and on the other feels it her duty to save her sons \u2019 happiness by building their future on a structure of lies and deceit . And she reaches a solution , not by reasoning the tangle out , not by any real thought for her boys , their general moral welfare , not by any attention to principles , but simply by discovering that her husband has been sexually unfaithful to her . Further , he becomes a cad and charges her with infidelity . Then she springs upon him and beats him with her fists , which is not the most effective way of convincing an audience that she was a woman capable of being torn by moral problems . Of course as the play is written , there is no moral problem . The morality is all of the theatre . It belongs to that strange world behind the proscenium , wherein we gaze , and gazing sometimes utter chatter about \u201c strong situations , \u201d \u201c stirring climaxes , \u201d and the like , as people hypnotized . There might have been a moral problem if Mrs. Granger , before she discovered her husband 's guilt , had been forced to fight a rising tide of passion for Temple in her own heart . There might have been a moral problem after the discovery and her first hasty , but natural , destruction of the letter , if she had felt that her desire to save Temple was prompted by a passion still illicit , rather than by justice . But no such real problems were presented . The lady babbles eternally of \u201c saving her boys \u2019 good name , \u201d while you are supposed to weep for her plight . Unless you have checked your sense of reality in the cloak room , you scorn her perceptions and despise her standards . How much finer had she continued to love her husband ! But he , after all , was only the \u201c father of her boys . \u201dIt is insufficiently motivated characterization which Mr. Eaton censures in The Nigger : Obviously , the emotional interest in this play is \u2014 or should be , rather \u2014 in the tragedy of the proud , ambitious Morrow , who wakes suddenly to find himself a \u201c nigger , \u201d an exile from his home , and hopes , from his sweetheart and his dreams . Yet , as Mr. Sheldon has written it , and as it was played by Mr . Guy Bates Post in the part of Morrow , and by the other actors , the play is most poignant in its moments of sheer theatrical appeal , almost of melodrama , such as the suspense of the cross-examination of the old mammy and her cry of revelation , or the pursuit of the fugitive in act one . Between his interest in the suspense of his story and in the elucidation of the broader aspects of the negro question in the South , Mr. Sheldon neglected too much his chief figure , as a human being . Unless the figures live and suffer for the audience , unless their personal fate is followed , their minds and hearts felt as real , the naturalistic drama of contemporary life can have but little value , after all . That is what makes its technique so difficult and so baffling . From the moment when Morrow learned of his birth , he became a rather nebulous figure , not suffering so much as listening to theories which were only said by the dramatist to have altered his character and point of view .Perhaps it would be more strictly accurate to say that the comment on The Nigger points to inadequate treatment of character changing as the play progresses . The favorite place of many so-called dramatists for a change of character is in their vast silences between the acts . There , the authors expect us to believe that marked and necessary changes take place . They show us in clear-cut dramatic action the good character before he became bad and after he has become bad , but for proof that the changes took place , we must look off stage in the entr'acte . Read Lady Bountiful and note that between the last and the next to the last acts large changes have taken place in the main characters . Iris would be a far greater play than it is could we have seen how its central figure passes from the taking of the check book to the state of mind which makes her accept Maldonado 's apartment . Contrast with these plays the thoroughly motivated change in the Sergeant of The Rising of the Moon or of Nora in A Doll 's House . Where American plays too frequently break down is in what may be called the logic of character . Even when actions have been properly motivated up to the last act or scene , this is handled in such a way as rather to please the audience than to grow inevitably out of what has preceded . Rumor has it that when Secret Service was produced in one of the central cities of New York State , the hero at the end chose his country rather than the girl . The public , with that fine disregard in the theatre for the values it places on action outside , disapproved . Promptly , the ending was so changed that the two lovers could be started on that sure road to happiness ever after which all men know an engagement is \u2014 upon the stage . In a play such as Secret Service , planned primarily to entertain , such a shift may be pardonable , but even in such a case it must be done with skill if it is not to jar . The Two Gentlemen of Verona in some fifty lines at its close shows Proteus madly in love with Silvia , and Valentine longing for her also ; Valentine threatening the life of Proteus when he discovers the latter 's perfidy , but forgiving him instantly when Proteus merely asks pardon ; and Proteus , when he discovers that the page who has been following him is Julia , turning instantly away from Silvia to her . Here is faulty characterization in two respects : each change is not sufficiently motived ; each does not accord with the characterization of Proteus and Valentine in the earlier scenes .", "Jones \\ ordinary , well-educated people .

Brede is enthusiastic and compares it with that from the Matterhorn . Mrs. Brede and Mrs. Jones come from the house in time to hear \u201c Matterhorn \u201d and Mrs. Brede expresses surprise that her husband has climbed it . Mr. Brede , confused , says it was five years ago , and Mrs. Brede gently chides him for doing such a thing during the first year of their marriage .

A lighted lamp on the table . Mrs. Linde sits in an armchair and absently turns the pages of a book , tries to read , but seems unable to fix her attention ; once or twice she looks at her watch . Nora comes down from the dance ; uneasiness has driven her ; surprise at finding Mrs. Linde , who pretends that she wanted to see Nora in her costume . Helmer , displeased at her going away , comes to fetch her back . The Doctor also enters , but to say good-bye . Meanwhile Mrs. Linde has gone into the side room on the right . Scene between the Doctor , Helmer , and Nora . He is going to bed , he says , never to get up again ; they are not to come and see him ; there is ugliness about a death-bed . He goes out . Helmer goes upstairs again with Nora , after the latter has exchanged a few words of farewell with Mrs. Linde . Mrs. Linde alone . Then Krogstad . Scene and explanation between them . Both go out .

Nora in despair prepares for the final step ; is already at the door when Helmer enters with the open letter in his hand . Great scene . A ring . Letter to Nora from Krogstad . Final scene . Divorce . Nora leaves the house .Finally , here is the full scenario of a play which made a great success both in England and the United States and was seen by practically all the Continental countries , namely , Kismet . Notice how well it fulfils the requirements for a good scenario stated in this chapter , not because Mr. Knobloch had these rules in mind as he composed it , but because , as a trained dramatist , he instinctively gave these qualities to his scenario . Carefully studied in relation to the essentials of scenario writing just stated , it should remove all doubt in the mind of a student as to what a good scenario is and why it is an essential preliminary to a good play .

Dramatically speaking , then , illustrative action is not merely something which illustrates an idea or character , but it must be an illustration mirroring emotion of the persons in the play or creating it in the observer . What is the relation of illustrative action to dramatic situation ? The first is the essence of the second . A dramatic episode presents an individual or group of individuals so moved as to stir an audience to responsive emotion . Illustrative action by each person in the group or by the group as a whole is basal . The glove incident in The Changeling concerns both Beatrice and De Flores . Hers is illustrative action when she shrinks from the glove his hand has touched . He shows it when kissing and amorously fondling the glove she has refused . Their illustrative actions make together the dramatic episode of the glove ,\u2014 which is in turn a part of Scene 1 of the first act of the play . There are the divisions : play , act , scene , episode , and illustrative action . Just as sometimes the development of a single episode may make a scene , or there may be but one scene to an act , there are cases when an illustrative action is a dramatic episode . The ending of Act II of Ostrovsky 's Storm illustrates this . Varvara , who has just gone out , has put into the hands of Catherine the key to a gate in the garden hedge . This Varvara has taken without the knowledge of her mother , who is the mother-in-law of Catherine . Just as Varvara goes , she has said that if she meets Catherine 's lover , Boris , she will tell him to come to the gate . Catherine , terrified , at first tries to refuse the key , but Varvara insists on leaving it with her ."]}, "act_index": 6, "play_index": 6}, {"data": {"294": ["Madam ,", "According as your ladyship desir 'd ,", "Whose glory fills the world with loud report .", "To visit her poor castle where she lies ,"]}, "act_index": 6, "play_index": 6}, {"data": {"295": ["Will turn unto a peaceful comic sport ,", "Is it even so ?

The Countess awaits Talbot ; he comes ; she reviles him in a few lines ; he turns to go ; she declares him a prisoner ; he laughs at her ; and as she stands amazed , calls in his forces brought in secret to the castle . When Talbot invites himself and his men to feast at her expense , the Countess immediately agrees . Reading the scene , one recalls the words of Dumas fils : \u201c Any one can relate a dramatic situation : the art lies in preparing it , getting it accepted , making it plausible , especially in untying the knot . \u201dHere Shakespeare does not untie the knot ; the Countess merely yields . What she feels , what happened thereafter ,\u2014 all these are omitted . It is merely the situation which counts . Before Talbot comes in , the scene could easily be made to reveal much more of the character of the Countess . When he does enter , the play of wits between them , even as it disclosed character , might provide interesting dramatic conflict . Surely the moment when the Countess thinks Talbot trapped and he coolly jeers at her , is worth more development . Here it is treated so quickly that the surprise in the entrance of the soldiers hardly gets its full effect . All this is the work of a tyro , even if he be Shakespeare . In Richard II , there is a scene , not as long as that just quoted , in which the central situation might seem to many people less dramatic than that of Talbot and the Countess , yet note to what a clear and convincing conclusion Shakespeare brings it , how plausible he makes the scene , how thoroughly he prepares it for the largest emotional effect by entering thoroughly into the characters involved .", "To give their censure of these rare reports .", "And his achievements of no less account ;", "I shall as famous be by this exploit", "And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs .", "For in my gallery thy picture hangs ;", "That hast by tyranny these many years", "Laughest thou , wretch ?

Away , be gone !So far as the situation is concerned we might go directly from York 's \u201c fealty to the new made King \u201d to his \u201c What seal is that ? \u201d omitting some ten lines . We should lose , however , the deft touches which make the discovery all the more dramatic ,\u2014 the words of York which show that he has no idea that his son is really involved in any disloyalty ; the affectionate effort of the mother to draw the talk from unpleasant subjects ; and the distrait mood of Aumerle . Again , the discovery of the contents of the seal might be made at once , but the fifteen intervening lines before York cries \u201c Treason ! foul treason ! \u201d increase our suspense by their clear presentation of the emotions of father , mother , and son . Once more the situation is held when York does not declare at once the nature of the treason and the frantic mother demands again and again the contents of the paper before Aumerle says bitterly , and in perfect character with his first speeches of the scene , \u201c it is no more Than my poor life must answer . \u201d Still again we should have the necessary action of the scene perfectly if York , as soon as he has his boots , flung out of the room , to be followed immediately by the Duchess , crying that she will follow him to the King and ask the boy 's pardon . However , had Shakespeare 's treatment here been that he used in the scene of Talbot and the Countess we should have lacked the perfect portrayal of the mother who loses all sense of right and wrong in fear that her loved child may die . Finally , do we not gain greatly by the characterization of the Duchess in the last lines of the scene ? Five times , then , Shakespeare , by entering into his characters , \u201c holds the situation . \u201d The second act of The Magistrate ,by Sir Arthur Pinero , is in central situation broadly this . Cis Farringdon , represented by his mother to his stepfather , Mr. Posket , as fourteen , because she does not like to admit her own age , is really nineteen and precocious at that . He has brought Mr. Posket to one of his haunts , a supper room in the Hotel des Princes , Meek Street , London , where they are to sup together . As Mr. Posket is a police justice , he has been induced to figure for the evening as \u201c Skinner of the stock exchange . \u201d Shortly after the arrival of the two comes word that a frequenter of the restaurant twenty years ago , now returned to London , wants to sup in their chosen room for the sake of old times . Therefore Mr. Posket and Cis are put into an adjoining room . Colonel Lukyn , the returned stranger , and a friend , Captain Vale , enter . Just as they are ordering supper , a note comes to the effect that Mrs. Posket , with a woman friend , is below , begging to speak with her old acquaintance , Colonel Lukyn . As Mrs. Posket asks a private interview , Captain Vale is put out on the balcony . With Mrs. Posket comes her sister Charlotte . We have already learned from Vale that he is deeply depressed because he thinks Charlotte no longer cares for him . Mrs. Posket has come to beg Colonel Lukyn , who knew her before she became a widow , not to reveal the truth about her age . Watch now the permutations and combinations the author develops from this general situation . Cis is hardly in the room before Isadore presents his bill for past meals . Cis sees the chance , by borrowing from his stepfather , to settle a long postponed account . Three figures , moved in turn by shrewdness , trickiness , and gullibility , stir us to amusement , giving us Situation I . Even as the bill is paid , Cis asks Isadore to show Mr. Skinner the trick of \u201c putting the silver to bed . \u201d Three people amused or interested by a trick , amuse us \u2014 Situation II . With the coming of the note from Alexander Lukyn , and the assignment of the room adjoining to Cis and Mr. Skinner-Posket , there is a hint of future complication which amuses us \u2014 Situation III . Lukyn and Vale entering , the former sentimental over his memories of the place , and the latter comically depressed over what he thinks to be the faithlessness of Charlotte Verrinder , give us Situation IV . The note saying Mrs. Posket is below with a friend , asking a private interview , produces Situation V , for it amuses us to think what may happen with Mr. Posket and Cis just on the other side of the door . Placing Vale on the balcony leads to Situation VI , for he goes with amusing regret for the delayed supper . Up to this point the situations may be declared parts of the main situation , which must now itself be developed . Just after Blond , the proprietor , ushers in the ladies , the pattering of rain outside is heard ."]}, "act_index": 6, "play_index": 6}, {"data": {"304": ["God knows I had as lief be none as one .", "Good mother , have content ; it is no more", "Madam , I know not , nor I greatly care not", "My lord , \u2018 tis nothing .", "Than my poor life must answer ."]}, "act_index": 6, "play_index": 6}, {"data": {"305": ["You 'll dare to lock us up all night ?", "By George , is it ?Poor devil !There is n't any method of getting off that balcony is there ?"]}, "act_index": 6, "play_index": 6}, {"data": {"306": ["The rain outside .

Seven are developed from that sixth by means of four people . The new complication , the search of the restaurant by the police and the bringing into one room of all the figures , gives us six more situations . Certainly Sir Arthur knows how to \u201c hold a situation . \u201d Act III of Mrs. Dane 's Defenceis just equally divided between preparatory material and the great scene which ebbs and flows about the following situation . Mrs. Dane , in love with Lionel , the adopted son of Sir Daniel Carteret , at the opening of the scene has lied so successfully about her past that Sir Daniel , who has been suspicious of her , has been entirely convinced of her innocence . Eager to help her set herself right , he asks in the kindest way for information which may aid him . Trying not to commit herself , Mrs. Dane slips once or twice and all the old suspicions of Sir Daniel are rearoused . He cross-examines her so rigidly that ultimately she breaks down and confesses . Handled by the inexperienced that situation might have been good for four or five pages . As treated by Mr. H. A . Jones , it makes a scene of twenty pages of finest suspense and climax . The situation is well held because every reaction upon it by the two characters has been worked out . One would hardly think two quarrelsome inmates of a poorhouse , visited by a relative of one of them who wishes to take him away to manage her place , likely to produce a masterpiece of comic drama . Yet it does with Lady Gregory in The Workhouse Ward ,for she knows Irish character and speech so intimately that minor situation after minor situation develops , through the characters , from the original situation . Indeed , much of our so-called new drama is but a prolonged holding of a situation stated as the play opens , or clearly before us at the end of Act I . Chainsof Miss Elizabeth Baker in Act I puts this double situation before us . A young married man without children , though happy enough in his marriage , is so weary of the sordidness of his small means and limited opportunities that he longs to break away , go out to Australia , and when he has made a career for himself , send for his wife . His sister-in-law , a shop girl , equally weary of her life , is weakly thinking of marrying a man she does not love , but who really loves her , in order to escape the grayness of her life . At the end of the play these two are accepting the situations in which we found them . Yet the three acts of the play are full of varied interest for an audience , so admirably does the writer discern the situations which her characters will develop from the original situation . Hindle Wakes ,the best play of Stanley Houghton , is really a study of the way in which a situation which took place before the play began affects three families . Surely it must now be evident that if a dramatist should in the first place understand perfectly that illustrative action is the core of drama , and must be carefully selected ; and secondly that he must , among possible illustrative actions , select those which quickest will produce the largest emotional results ; he must also recognize that till he has searched and probed his situations by means of the characters , in the first place he cannot know which are his strongest , and in the second place cannot hope to hold the situations chosen . Another complaint from the inexperienced dramatist when shaping up his story is that though he sees the big moments in his play , he does not see his way from one to another . That is , transitional scenes are lacking . They will not worry him long , however , if he follows the methods just stated for holding a situation . Let him watch the people who have come into his imagination , first simply as people . Who and what are they ? Secondly , what are they feeling and thinking in the situations which have occurred to him ? He can n't long consider this without deciding what people they must have been in order to be in the situations in question . Hard upon this comes the question : \u201c What will people who have been like these and have passed through this experience do immediately , and thereafter ? \u201d In the answer to the question , \u201c What have they been ? \u201d he finds the transitional scenes which take him back into an earlier episode ; in the answer to \u201c What will they become ? \u201d the transitional scenes that carry him forward . In the scene cited from Richard II the main moments are the home-coming , the discovery of the traitorous paper , and the departure of the Duke and Duchess of York . How is the transition from one to the other to be gained ? Through knowledge of the characters , as the analysis showed . What applies here to transition within a scene from dramatic moment to dramatic moment applies equally in transition from scene to scene . Suppose that Sir Arthur Pinero had as the starting-point of the third act of The Magistrate the idea that Mrs. Posket should be arrested under such conditions that she must appear in the court of her husband when he is as guilty as she . Sir Arthur has decided that they must be in some place like the Hotel des Princes when it is raided . He has in mind episodes which will bring them all together at that place . He already sees clearly the scene of the raid and the arrest . But the place cannot be raided till late in the evening , and Agatha Posket is too jealous of her reputation thoughtlessly to stay late in such a place . What are to be the transitional \u201c scenes \u201d which , in the first place , shall make us feel that considerable time has passed since Mrs. Posket came to the hotel , and secondly shall keep us amused ? Sir Arthur finds them through the characters . It is the hunger of self-indulgent Charlotte which motivates the staying and gives us the supper \u201c scene . \u201d It is the character of Vale which gives us his quarrel with Lukyn . The love making of Charlotte and Vale provides another transitional \u201c scene . \u201d In other words , whether one is looking for more episodes or for transitions from one chosen episode to another , one should not go far afield hunting episodes as episodes , but should become acquainted with the characters as closely as possible . They will solve the difficulties . All this lengthy consideration of selection makes for unity of action in the story resulting . Some unity of action , whether the story be slight or complicated , there must be . Of the three great unities over which there has been endless discussion , Action , Place , and Time , the modern dramatists , as we shall see , treat Place with the greatest freedom , and are constantly inventing devices to avoid the Time difficulty . With the dramatists of the present , as with the dramatists of the past , however , what they write must be a whole , a unit . Some central idea , plan , purpose , whatever we choose to call it , must give the play organic structure . Story is the first step to this . Which gives most pleasure ,\u2014 a string of disconnected anecdotes and jests ; or a series of them given some unity because they concern some man of note , for instance , Abraham Lincoln ; or the same series edited till , taken all together , they make Abraham Lincoln , in one or more of his characteristics , clearer than ever before ? Does not a large part of our pleasure in biography come from the way in which it co-ordinates and interprets episodes and incidents hitherto not properly inter-related in our minds ? Unity of action is , then , of first importance in story . There is , however , another kind of unity which has not been enough considered ,\u2014 what may , perhaps , be called artistic unity . Why is it that a play which begins seriously and for most of its course so develops , only to end farcically , or which begins lightly only to become tragic , leaves us dissatisfied ? Because the audience finds it difficult to readjust its mood as swiftly as does the author . The Climbersand The Girl With the Green Eyesof Clyde Fitch are examples in point . The first begins with such dignity and mysteriousness that its lighter moods , after Act I , seem almost trivial . In the second play the very tragic scene of the attempted suicide , after the light comedy touch of the preceding parts , is distinctly jarring . A recent play which for two acts or more seemingly had been dealing with but slightly disguised figures of the political world had a late scene in which one of these politicians , like Manson in The Servant in the House ,or The Stranger in The Passing of the Third Floor Back ,shadowed the figure of Christ himself . The effect was jarring , unpleasant , and confusing , mainly because of its suddenness . It will be noted that in both the plays mentioned , Manson and The Stranger carry their suggestion from the start . Should we know how to take Percinet and Sylvette in The Romancersof Rostand did not that opening scene , when these two , in love with being in love , read Romeo and Juliet together , prepare us for all the later fantasy ? A dramatist will do well , then , to know clearly before he begins to write whether he wishes his story to be melodrama , tragedy , farce , or comedy of character or intrigue . Unless he does and in consequence selects his illustrative material so that he may give it artistic unity , he is likely to produce a play of so mixed a genre as to be confusing . \u201c Just what is tragi-comedy , then ? \u201d a reader may ask . The Elizabethan dramatist frequently offered one serious and one comic plot , running parallel except when brought together in the last scene of the play . Technically , however , tragi-comedy is a form which , although it may contain tragic elements , is throughout given a general emphasis as comedy and ends in comedy . We do not have good tragi-comedy when most of the play is comedy or tragedy , and one scene or act is distinctly the opposite . Therefore not only unity of action but artistic unity , unity of genre , should be sought by the dramatist shaping up his story . How much story does a play require ? This is a difficult point to settle , but first of all let us clearly understand that there are great differences in audiences as far as plotting is concerned . Some periods require more plot than others . Today we do not demand , as did the audience of Shakespeare 's time , plays containing two or more stories , sometimes scarcely at all connected , sometimes neatly interwoven . Middleton 's The Changelingcontains two almost independent stories . This is nearly as true of The Coxcombby Beaumont and Fletcher . On the other hand , in Much Ado About Nothing the Hero-Claudio story , the Beatrice-Benedict story , and the Dogberry-Verges story are so deftly interwoven that they are , to all appearances , a unit . Even as late as thirty years ago one found in many plays a group of characters for the serious interest and another for the comic values . Gradually , however , dramatists have come to get their comic values from people essential to the serious story , or from a comic emphasis they place on certain aspects of the serious figures of the play . Today is the time of the single story rather than the interwoven story . Yet even now , so far as the public of the United States is concerned , a writer may easily go too far in simplicity , or rather scantiness of story , trusting too much to admirable characterization . That is why that delightful play , The Mollusc ,failed in this country . Many people , among them the intelligent , declared the play too thin to give them pleasure . That is , apparently we of the United States care more in our plays for elaborate stories than do our English cousins . Indeed , national taste differs as to the amount of plot desirable . Both Americans and English care more for plot than do most of the Continental nations , which are often satisfied with plays of slight story-value but admirable characterization . Nor is the difference a new one . Writing of Wycherley 's arrangement of Moliere 's Misanthrope in his Plain Dealer , Voltaire said , \u201c The English author has corrected the only fault of Moliere 's piece , lack of plot . \u201dIn the same Letter on Comedy , Voltaire brings out clearly what any student of English drama knows , that all through its greatest period it depended far more on complicated story than did the drama of the Continent . Lessing in his Hamburg Dramaturgy , speaking of Colman 's The English Merchant , says it has not action enough for the English critics . \u201c Curiosity is not sufficiently fostered , the whole complication is visible in the first act . We Germans are well content that the action is not richer and more complex . The English taste on this point distracts and fatigues us , we love a simple plot that can be grasped at once . The English are forced to insert episodes into French plays if they are to please on their stage . In like manner we have to weed episodes out of the English plays if we want to introduce them to our stage . The best comedies of Congreve and Wycherley would seem intolerable to us without this excision . We manage better with their tragedies . In part these are not so complex and many of them have succeeded well amongst us without the least alteration , which is more than I could say for any of their comedies . \u201dAbout all the generalization one may permit one 's self here is : For the public of the United States one can at present feel sure that story increases its interest in characterization , however fine . As we shall see in dealing with character , the latter should never be sacrificed to story , but story often ferries a play from the shore of unsuccess to the shore of success . Even today it is not the great poetry , the subtle characterization nor the fine thinking of Hamlet which give it large audiences : it is the varied story , full of surprises and suspense . In another way , Hamlet is a case in point . It shows the impossibility of laying down any golden rule as to the amount of story a play should have . Only speaking broadly is it true that different kinds of plays seem to call for different amounts of story . Melodrama obviously does depend on story-happenings often unmotivated and forced on the characters by the will of the dramatist . Romance is almost synonymous with action and we associate with it a large amount of story . The word Intrigue in the title \u201c Comedy of Intrigue \u201d at once suggests story . Tragedy and High Comedy , on the other hand , depend for their values on subtle characterization . In these last two forms it would seem that the increasing characterization must , because of the time limit , mean decrease in the amount of story ; then Hamlet , with its complicated story , occurs to us as by no means a single instance of a play of subtle characterization in complicated story . Farce may be either of character or of situation , but there are also farces in which both situation and character have the exaggerations which distinguish this form from comedy . Comedy of Manners must obviously use much characterization , but it does not preclude a complicated story . Melodrama , then , does call above all else for story . With all the other forms it is in the last analysis the common sense of the dramatist which must tell him how much story to use . He will employ the amount the time limits permit him if he is at the same time to do justice to his characters and to the idea , if any , he may wish to convey . That is , story as we have been watching it develop from the point of departure is , for the dramatist , story in the rough . It is only when it has been proportioned and emphasized so that upon the stage it will produce in an audience the exact emotional effects desired by the dramatist that it becomes plot . Just as the point of departure for a play comes to a writer as a kind of unconscious selection from among all possible subjects , so we have seen that story takes shape by a similar process of conscious or unconscious selection till it is something with a beginning , a middle , and an end , and clear . Nor does selection stop here . The very necessary proportioning and emphasizing mean , as we shall see , that the dramatist selects , and again selects . FOOTNOTES :Samuel French , New York .Chas .

CHAPTER V FROM SUBJECT TO PLOT : PROPORTIONING THE MATERIAL : NUMBER AND LENGTH OF ACTS A dramatist , proportioning his rough story for performance in the limited space of time the stage permits , faces at once the question : \u201c How many acts ? \u201d If inexperienced , noting the number of changes of set his story seems to demand he finds himself in a dilemma : to give an act to each change of scene is to break the play into many scrappy acts of a few minutes each ; to crowd all his needed scenes into five acts is to get scenes as scrappy as the eight which make the fifth act of Shakespeare 's Macbeth or the ten in Act IV of Henry VI , Part II . In either case , if he gives his numerous scenes adequate treatment , he is likely to find their combined length forces him beyond the time limit the theatre allows \u2014 about two hours and a half . Let him rid himself immediately of any feeling that custom or dramatic dignity calls for any preference among three , four , or five acts . The Elizabethan drama put such a spell upon the imagination of English-speaking peoples that until recently the idea was accepted : \u201c Five is dignity , with a trailing robe , whereas one , two , or three acts would be short skirts , and degrading . \u201dToday a dramatist may plan for a play of three , four , or five acts , as seems to him best . Why , if no change of scene be required , is not a play of one long act desirable ? At first sight , there would seem to be a gain in the unbroken movement . The power of sustained attention in audiences is , however , distinctly limited . Any one who has seen a performance of The Trojan Womenby Euripides , or von Hofmannsthal 's Electraneeds no further proof that though each makes a short evening 's entertainment it is exhausting because of uninterrupted movement from start to finish . To plays of one long act most audiences become unresponsive from sheer physical fatigue . Consequently , use has confined one-act plays to subjects that may be treated in fifteen minutes to an hour , with an average length of from twenty to forty-five minutes . Strindberg has stated well the problem which the play in one long act involves : \u201c I have tried , \u201d he wrote in his Introduction to Miss Julia , \u201c to abolish the division into acts . And I have done so because I have come to fear that our decreasing capacity for illusion might be unfavorably affected by intermissions during which the spectator would have time to reflect and to get away from the suggestive influence of the author-hypnotist . My play will probably last an hour and a half , and as it is possible to listen that length of time , or longer , to a lecture , a sermon , or a debate , I have imagined that a theatrical performance could not become fatiguing in the same time . As early as 1872 , in one of my first dramatic experiments , The Outlaw , I tried the same concentrated form , but with scant success . The play was written in five acts , and wholly completed , when I became aware of the restless , scattered effect it produced . Then I burned it , and out of the ashes rose a single , well-built act , covering fifty printed pages , and taking an hour for its performance . Thus the form of the present play is not new , but it seems to be my own , and changing aesthetical conventions may possibly make it timely . \u201c My hope is still for a public educated to a point where it can sit through a whole-evening performance in a single act . But that point cannot be reached without a great deal of experimentation . \u201dThe difficulty with a play of only two acts is similar . If the piece is to fill an evening , each act must last an hour or more .

To all these human or unhuman aids some overburdened soul has felt free to say anything the audience might need to hear . Probably this use of the telephone has come to stay , for daily there is proof that nothing is too intimate for it . There are , however , more ambitious workers who , weary of servants , confidants , telephones , stenographers , and dictaphones , want to set forth necessary information so naturally that no one may question whether it might have come out in this way . Also , they want the information to be so interestingly conveyed that an auditor thinks of what is happening rather than merely of the facts . In the first act of The Second Mrs. Tanqueray ,the audience must hear a narrative setting forth Aubrey Tanqueray 's position in society , his first marriage , his relations with his daughter , and the nature of his proposed second marriage . What complicates the task is that the narrative must be told to old friends , so that much of it is to them well known . What device will make the narrative , under the circumstances , plausible ? Here is where a modern dramatist sighs for the serviceable heralds , messengers , and chorus of plays of decades long past or for the freer methods in narrative of the novelist . How easy to tell much of this in your own person , as have Thackeray or Meredith , in comparison with stating it through another so placed that he will be glad to hear again much which he already knows ! The necessity creates with Sir Arthur the device of the little supper party in Aubrey Tanqueray 's chambers in the Albany , to which he has invited four of his oldest friends . The moment chosen for the opening of the play is when the old friends , over the coffee , fall quite naturally into reminiscent vein . What helps to freer exposition is their chance to talk of Cayley Drummle , who , even yet , though bidden , has not appeared . Before the chat is over and Cayley enters , much needed information is in the minds of the audience . Cayley brings news of a terrible mesalliance in a family known to all the supper party . In his efforts to advise and comfort the distracted mother he has been kept from the meeting of old friends . The news leads Aubrey Tanqueray to avow his quixotic scheme for a second marriage . Through the contrasting comments of the friends , even through their reservations , the audience becomes perfectly informed as to the view the world will take of this second marriage . Indeed , as the supper party breaks up , all the audience requires in order to listen intelligently to the succeeding acts , is a chance to see Paula herself . Her impulsive visit to Tanqueray , just after the supper party ends , provides the information needed , for in it her character is sketched in broadly as it will be filled out in detail in the succeeding acts . Evidently device , the ingenious discovery of a plausible reason for exposition necessary in a play , is basal in the best stage narrative . Without it , character is sacrificed to mere necessary exposition ; with it , the spectator , absorbed by incident or characterization , learns unconsciously that without which he cannot intelligently and sympathetically follow the story of the play . In other words , successful discovery of devices for such exposition clearly means that disguising which is essential to the best narrative in drama . The first quality of good expository device is clearness . Secondly , it should be an adequate reason for the exposition it contains : i. e ., it must seem natural that the facts should come out in this way . Thirdly , and of the utmost importance , the device must be something so interesting in itself as to hold the attention of an auditor while necessary facts are insinuated into his mind . Lastly , the device should permit this preliminary exposition to be given swiftly . It is hard to conceal exposition as such if the movement is as slow as in the first two scenes of Act I of The Journey of Papa Perrichon . ACT I The Lyons railway station at Paris .

The original dialogue was scrappy , lacking sequence , not so much of thought as of emotion . If it be said that at such a moment talk is often fitful , it must be remembered that our time-limits forbid giving every word said in such a scene . We must present merely its essentials . Only in that way may a play , a condensed presentation of life , hope to give a total effect for a scene equal to that of the original . The re-ordered dialogue of the right-hand column seeks merely to bring together ideas really closely related , and to move , in a way in keeping with the characters , from lesser to stronger emotion . With the disappearance of the scrappy effect , is not the result clearer ? Even now , the dialogue might well be condensed and made emotionally more significant .

In the second , everything springs seemingly unassisted from the characters .

Yeats tells of rehearsing a young actress who stumbled constantly over the line And then I looked up and saw you coming toward me , I know not whether from the north , the south , the east or the west . She gave it with no sense of its contained rhythm , and always came to a full stop after \u201c toward me , \u201d adding the last words almost unwillingly . When asked why she did this , she said that all which followed seemed to her unnecessary : the important fact was contained in what preceded . It took much rehearsing to make the young woman see that the music of the line is characteristic of the dales people , and so has characterizing value , and that she had totally forgotten the situation of the woman speaking . A peddler has come to the only hut in a lonely valley . The woman welcomes him heartily , not that she may buy , but because after days in which she has seen no one except her \u201c man , \u201d she is greedy for talk . Having bargained as long as she can , very regretfully she sees the man departing , and , other topics being exhausted , she tells him of her pleasure in his coming , spinning out her phrase as long as she possibly can in order to hold him . Out of that set of conditions springs a highly characterizing phrase that also has beauty . If Synge had done no more by his plays than to make us recognize in the speech of the peasant the characterizing power and the beauty for him who has \u201c the eye to see and the ear to hear , \u201d his work would deserve permanent fame . He states his ideas in the preface to The Playboy of the Western World . In writing The Playboy of the Western World , as in my other plays , I have used one or two words only that I have not heard among the country people of Ireland , or spoken in my own nursery before I could read the newspapers . A certain number of the phrases I employ I have heard also from herds and fishermen along the coast from Kerry to Mayo , or from beggar-women and ballad-singers near Dublin ; and I am glad to acknowledge how much I owe to the folk-imagination of these fine people . Any one who has lived in real intimacy with the Irish peasantry will know that the wildest sayings and ideas in this play are tame indeed , compared with the fancies one may hear in any little hillside cabin in Geesala , or Carraroe , or Dingle Bay . All art is a collaboration ; and there is little doubt that in the happy ages of literature , striking and beautiful phrases were as ready to the story-teller 's or the playwright 's hand as the rich cloaks and dresses of his time . It is probable that when the Elizabethan dramatist took his ink-horn and sat down to his work he used many phrases that he had just heard as he sat at dinner , from his mother or his children . In Ireland , those of us who know the people have the same privilege . When I was writing The Shadow of the Glen , some years ago , I got more aid than any learning could have given me from a chink in the floor of the old Wicklow house where I was staying , that let me hear what was being said by the servant girls in the kitchen . This matter , I think , is of importance for in countries where the imagination of the people , and the language they use , is rich and living , it is possible for a writer to be rich and copious in his words , and at the same time to give the reality , which is the root of all poetry , in a comprehensive and natural form . In the modern literature of towns , however , richness is found only in sonnets , or prose poems , or in one or two elaborate books that are far away from the profound and common interests of life . One has , on one side , Mallarme and Huysmans producing this literature ; and on the other Ibsen and Zola dealing with the reality of life in joyless and pallid words . On the stage one must have reality , and one must have joy ; and that is why the intellectual modern drama has failed , and people have grown sick of the false joy of the musical comedy , that has been given them in place of the rich joy found only in what is superb and wild in reality . In a good play every speech should be as fully flavoured as a nut or apple , and such speeches cannot be written by any one who works among people who have shut their lips on poetry . In Ireland , for a few years more , we have a popular imagination that is fiery and magnificent , and tender ; so that those of us who wish to write start with a chance that is not given to writers in places where the springtime of the local life has been forgotten , and the harvest is a memory only , and the straw has been turned into bricks .As Ibsen says , \u201c Style must conform to the degree of ideality which pervades the representation . \u201d You are of opinion that the drama ought to have been written in verse , and that it would have gained by this . Here I must differ from you . The play is , as you must have observed , conceived in the most realistic style ; the illusion I wished to produce was that of reality . I wished to produce the impression on the reader that what he was reading was something that had really happened . If I had employed verse I should have counteracted my own intention and prevented the accomplishment of the task I had set myself . The many ordinary , insignificant characters whom I have intentionally introduced into the play would have become indistinct , and indistinguishable from one another , if I had allowed all of them to speak in one and the same rhythmical measure . We are no longer living in the days of Shakespeare . Speaking generally , the style must conform to the degree of ideality which pervades the representation . My new drama is no tragedy in the ancient acceptation ; what I desired to depict were human beings , and therefore I would not let them talk \u201c the language of the Gods . \u201dThe dramatist who would write dialogue of the highest order should have not only an inborn and highly trained feeling for the emotional significance of the material in hand ; a fine feeling for characterization ; ability to write dialogue which states facts in character ; and the power to bring out whatever charm , grace , irony , wit , or other specially attractive qualities his characters permit ; also he should have , or develop , a strong feeling for the nicest use of language . Dumas fils said , \u201c There should be something of the poet , the artist in words , in every dramatist . \u201d FOOTNOTES :", "Massey .

A dim gray haze next fills the stage , and through this gradually breaks the rising sun . The birds begin to wake , and suddenly there is heard the loud , deep-toned , single toll of a bell , followed by a roll of muffled drums in the distance . Slowly the orchard fills with murmuring , whispering people ; men and women coming up through the trees make a semicircle amongst them , about the gallows tree , but at a good distance . The bell tolls at intervals , and muffled drums are heard between the twittering and happy songs of birds . There is the sound of musketry , of drums beating a funeral march , which gets nearer , and finally a company of British soldiers marches in , led by Fitzroy , Nathan Hale in their midst , walking alone , his hands tied behind his back . As he comes forward the people are absolutely silent , and a girl in the front row of the spectators falls forward in a dead faint . She is quickly carried out by two bystanders .

A loutish beast agrees to gamble for a woman he is kidnapping with a young adventurer who sees at the moment no other way to save her from the other man 's clutches . The scene is not at all improbable for either man . In The Princess and the Butterfly , all the preceding acts are but a preparation for what the world will call the unreason , in the last act , of the marriages of Sir George and the Princess Pannonia ,\u2014 of middle age with youth . Their final conduct would seem unplausible were it not entirely in keeping with their characters as carefully developed in the earlier parts of the play . The Rising of the Moon of Lady Gregory shows a final situation for the Police Sergeant which , at the opening of the play , would seem impossible for him . In a few pages , however , the dramatist so develops the character that we are perfectly ready to accept his sacrifice of the \u201c hundred pounds reward \u201d which he so coveted at the outset . Motivation should not , however , be allowed to obtrude itself , but should be subordinated to the emotional purpose of the scene . The modern auditor prefers to gather it almost unconsciously as the action of the play proceeds rather than to have it emphasized for him , as does Iago , at the end of several acts of Othello . Another instance of this frank motivation among the Elizabethans may be found in the soliloquy from The Duchess of Malfi :", "There 's only one condition . We play till I 'm beggared of every farthing I have , or till you 're beggared of them . Sit down !", "He must not look at it that way . We all have our little troubles .Do n't we ?

What most transmuted the Ur-Hamlet of Thomas Kyd into one of the greatest tragedies of all time was the characterization Shakespeare put into it . Certainly , characterization makes for dramatists the stepping-stones on which they may rise from dead selves to higher things . How may all this needed characterization best be done ? A dramatist should not permit himself to describe his characters , for in his own personality he has no proper place in the text . There the characters must speak and act for themselves . There has been , however , an increasing tendency lately to describe the dramatis personae of the play in programs , either in the list of characters or in a summary of the plot . Some writers apparently assume that every auditor reads his program carefully before the curtain goes up . Such an assumption is false : more than that it is lazy , incompetent , and thoroughly vicious , putting a play on the level with the motion pictures , which cannot depend wholly on themselves but would often be wholly vague without explanatory words thrown upon the canvas . Nor can the practice of the older dramatists like Wycherley and Shadwell , who often prefixed to their printed plays elaborate summaries describing the dramatis personae , be cited as a final defense . Sir William Belfond , a Gentleman of above 3 , 000 per annum , who in his youth had been a spark of the town , but married and retired into the country , where he turned to the other extreme , rigid and morose , most sordidly covetous , clownish , obstinate , positive , and froward . Sir Edward Belfond , his Brother , a merchant , who by lucky hits had gotten a great estate , lives single , with ease and pleasure , reasonably and virtuously . A man of great humanity and gentleness and compassion towards mankind ; well read in good books possessed with all gentleman-like qualities . Belfond , Senior , eldest son to Sir William ; bred after his father 's rustic , swinish manner , with great rigour and severity ; upon whom his father 's estate is entailed ; the confidence of which makes him break out into open rebellion to his father , and become lewd , abominably vicious , stubborn , and obstinate . Belfond , Junior , second Son to Sir William ; adopted by Sir Edward , and bred from his childhood by him , with all tenderness , and familiarity , and bounty , and liberty that can be , instructed in all the liberal sciences , and in all gentlemanlike education . Somewhat given to women , and now and then to good fellowship , but an ingenious , well-accomplished gentleman : a man of honour , and of excellent disposition and temper . Truman , his friend , a man of honour and fortune . Cheatly , a rascal , who by reason of debts dares not stir out of Whitefriars , but there inveigles young heirs in tail , and helps them to goods and money upon great disadvantages ; is bound for them , and shares with them , till he undoes them . A lewd , impudent , debauched fellow , very expert in the cant about town . Shamwell , cousin to the Belfonds , an heir , who being ruined by Cheatly , is made a decoy-duck for others ; not daring to stir out of Alsatia , where he lives . Is bound with Cheatly for heirs , and lives upon them a dissolute , debauched life . Captain Hackum , a blockheaded bully of Alsatia ; a cowardly , impudent , blustering fellow ; formerly a sergeant in Flanders , run from his colours , retreated into Whitefriars for a very small debt , where , by the Alsatians , he is dubbed a captain ; marries one that lets lodgings , sells cherry brandy , and is a bawd . Scrapeall , a hypocritical , repeating , praying , psalm-singing , precise fellow , pretending to great piety , a godly knave , who joins with Cheatly , and supplies young heirs with goods and money . Attorney to Sir William Belfond , who solicits his business and receives all his packets . Lolpoop , a North-country fellow , servant to Belfond , Senior , much displeased at his master 's proceedings .It is more than doubtful if anything so elaborate could be found in the manuscripts of Wycherley and Shadwell . Their purpose was doubtless the same as that of certain modern dramatists who , with a view to making plays less difficult for those unaccustomed to reading them , greatly amplify the stage directions before their plays go to print . Mr. Granville Barker in the manuscripts of his plays is particularly frugal of stage directions , but in the printed form of The Madras House ,practically the whole history of Julia is given in the opening stage direction : Julia started life \u2014 that is to say , left school \u2014 as a genius . The head mistress had had two or three years of such dull girls that really she could not resist this excitement . Watercolour sketches were the medium . So Julia was dressed in brown velveteen , and sent to an art school , where they would n't let her do watercolour drawing at all . And in two years she learnt enough about the trade of an artist not ever to want to do those watercolour drawings again . Julia is now over thirty , and very unhappy . Three of her watercolourshang on the drawing-room wall . They shame her , but her mother wo n't have them taken down . On a holiday she 'll be off now and then for a solid day 's sketching ; and as she tears up the vain attempt to put on paper the things she has learnt to see , she sometimes cries . It was Julia , Emma , and Jane who , some years ago , conspired to present their mother with that intensely conspicuous cosy corner . A cosy corner is apparently a device for making a corner just what the very nature of a corner should forbid it to be . They beggared themselves ; but one wishes that Mr. Huxtable were more lavish with his dress allowances , then they might at least have afforded something not quite so hideous . Such characterizing is an implied censure on the ability of most readers to see the full significance of deft touches in the dialogue . If not , then it is necessary because some part of it is not given in the text as it should be , or it is wholly unnecessary and undesirable , for the text , repeating all this detail , will be wearisome to an intelligent reader . The safest principle is , in preparing a manuscript for acting , to keep stage directions to matters of setting , lighting , essential movements , and the intonations which cannot , by the utmost efforts of the author , be conveyed by dialogue .In this last group belong certain every-day phrases susceptible of so many shadings that the actor needs guidance .

Let them describe themselves , or let other people on the stage describe or analyze them , when this is naturally convincing or may be made plausible by your skill . Trust , however , above all , to letting your characters live before your audience the emotions which interest you , thus making them convey their characters by the best means of communication between actor and audience \u2014 namely , action . In the chapterdealing with clearness in exposition the extreme importance of identifying the characters for the audience has been carefully treated .Closely connected with this identifying is the matter of entrances and exits . The characterizing value of exits and entrances is usually little understood by the inexperienced dramatist . Yet in real life , men and women cannot enter or leave a room without characterization . Watch the people in a railroad car as it nears the terminus . The people who rise and stand in the aisles are clearly of different natures from those who remain quietly seated till the train reaches its destination .

The End of the Third Act .Have you noticed that people under stress of strong emotion stop to depict their emotional condition , to analyze it , or neatly to apostrophize fate or Providence ? The more real the emotion the more compact and connotative , usually , is its expression . People under high emotional strain who can tell you just what they ought to feel , or who describe elaborately what they are feeling are usually \u201c indeed exceeding calm . \u201d Dryden 's Lyndaraxa builded better than she knew when she said : By my own experience I can tell Those who love truly do not argue well . Bulwer-Lytton was thinking of the weakness of self-descriptive woe when he wrote Macready , while composing Richelieu , \u201c In Act 4 \u2014 in my last alteration , when Richelieu , pitying Julie , says , \u2018 I could weep to see her thus \u2014 But \u2019 \u2014 the effect would I think be better if he felt the tears with indignation at his own weakness \u2014 thus : \u2018 Are these tears ? O , shame , shame , Dotage \u2019 \u2014 \u201d Emotion , if given free way , finds the right words by which to express itself . When a character stands outside itself , describing what it feels , the speaker is really the author in disguise , describing what he is incompetent , from lack of sympathetic power , to phrase with simple , moving accuracy . M. de Curel has described perfectly the right relation of author to character and dialogue . During the first days of work I have a very distinct feeling of creation . Later I move on instinctively and that is much better . When the sentiments of my characters are in question I am absolutely in their skins , for my own part indifferent as to their griefs or joys . I can be moved only later in re-reading , and then this emotion seems to arise from the fact that I have to do with characters absolutely strange to me . I experience sometimes , and then personally , a feeling of irony , of flippancy , in regard to my characters who tangle themselves up and get themselves into difficulties . That transpires sometimes in the language of some other character who , at the moment , ceases to speak correctly because he speaks as I should . As a result , corrections later . At the end of a year , my play , when I re-read it , seems something completely apart from me , written by another .Allowing a character to express itself exactly raises inevitably the question of dialect . On the one hand it must be admitted that nothing more quickly characterizes a figure , as far as type is concerned , than to let him speak like a Yankee , a Scotchman , a Negro , etc . If the character utters phrases which an audience recognizes instantly as characteristic of his supposed type , there is special satisfaction to the audience in such recognition . On the other hand , very few audiences know any dialect thoroughly enough to permit a writer to use it with absolute accuracy . The moment dialect begins to show the need of a glossary , it is defeating its own ends . As a result a compromise has arisen , dating from the very early days of the drama \u2014 stage dialects . A character made up to represent Scotchman , Welshman , Frenchman , Negro , or Indian , speaks in a way that has become time-honored on the stage as representing this or that figure among these types . Till recently most dialect on the stage has been at best a mere popular approximation to real usage . Until within a few years the peasant dialogue of Gammer Gurton 's Needle , the famous sixteenth-century Interlude , was supposed to represent dialect of its time in the neighborhood of Cambridge , England . Recently philologists have shown that the speech of these peasants is unlike any dialect of the period of the play , and was obviously a stage convention of the time . Study the Welshmen and other dialect parts in Shakespeare , and you will reach approximately the same conclusion . With our developing sense of historical truth and of realism , we have , in recent years , been trying to make our characters speak exactly as they would in real life . The plays of the Abbey Theatre are in large part a revolt from the Irish dialogue which the plays of Dion Boucicault had practically established as true to life . Today we try not only phonetically to represent the ways in which words are spoken by the people of a particular locality , but by the use of words and phrases heard among such people to make the characterization vivid and convincing . Here , in Mr. Sheldon 's play , The Nigger , is care to reproduce phonetically the speech of negroes :"]}, "act_index": 6, "play_index": 6}, {"data": {"434": ["I speck yo \u2019 right .

Noting their racy , apt , and highly individualized phrases , she gives them to her characters in the play as she re-writes . Such intimate , loving study of dialect as Lady Gregory , Mr. Yeats , and Synge have shown has given us an accurate representation of the Irish peasant , and may ultimately drive from the English stage the conventional absurdities of the past . Dialect , then , if carefully studied , is highly desirable if two or three facts are borne in mind . First of all , it should be accurate ; but secondly it must be clear or must be made clear for any audience . Unquestionably , Mr. Stanley Houghton 's memorable play Hindle Wakes had a bad title away from its birthplace ,\u2014 Manchester , England . In the United States , this title is perfectly meaningless . How many in any audience in this country could be expected to know that the title means certain \u201c autumn week-end holidays in the town of Hindle . \u201d There could be no harm in using a different title away from the birthplace of the play . Recently , in a manuscript play , appeared a figure speaking a strange mixture of Negro and Irish dialects . He seemed to all readers a clumsy attempt by the author at a dialect part . Really , the figure was a portrait of a small political boss who , from boyhood on , had acquired in the saloons and purlieus of his district words and phrases of both the Negroes and the Irish . A little preliminary exposition at the right place cleared up this difficulty and turned what seemed inept characterization into a particularly individual figure of richly characterizing phrase . Obviously , then , dialect should , first , be written accurately . Then it should be gone over to see what in it may not be clear to most auditors . These words or phrases should be made clear because they are translated by other people on the stage or by the speaker , who himself sees or is told that some stage listener does not understand him . Only a little ingenuity is needed to do away with such vaguenesses . To substitute for such words and phrases others which , though incorrect , would be instantly understood by the audience is to botch the dialect and produce what is , after all , not different from the conventional stage dialect of the past . This raises a third point in regard to dialect , and one very frequently disregarded . Over and over again in plays using dialect certain speeches are passed over by the author in his final revision which neither phonetically nor in the words and phrases chosen comport with the context . Instantly the mood and the color of the scene are lost unless the actor supplies what the author failed to give . That is , dialect , if used , should be used steadily and consistently . The desiderata are , then , accuracy , persistent use , and clearness for the general public . Thus used , dialect is one of the chief aids to characterization . If , in writing dialogue , a dramatist must not speak as himself but in character , must not be consciously or unconsciously literary if not in character , how may one surely choose the right words ? Perhaps one or two illustrations will help here . The citation in the left-hand column from the first quarto Hamlet states the facts clearly enough , but wholly uncolored by the emotion of the speaker . In the right-hand column the passionate sympathy of Shakespeare has given him perfect understanding of Hamlet 's feeling .", "But mos \u2019 people are willin \u2019 to fo'get \u2014 at least they ought to be .", "Why ?"]}, "act_index": 6, "play_index": 6}, {"data": {"438": ["He 's gone .

Short of that in dialogue , one stops at the commonplace and colorless , the personal , or the literary . Even , however , when dialogue expounds properly and is thoroughly in character , it will fail if not fitted for the stage . John Oliver Hobbes stated a truth , if somewhat exaggeratedly , in these lines of her preface to The Ambassador : Once I found a speech in prose \u2014 prose so subtly balanced , harmonious , and interesting that it seemed , on paper , a song : But no actor or actress , though they spoke with the voice of angels , could make it , on the stage , even tolerable .... Yet the speech is nevertheless fine stuff : it is nevertheless interesting in substance : it has imagination : it has charm . What , then , was lacking ? Emotion in the tone and , on the part of the writer , consideration for the speaking voice . Stage dialogue may have or may not have many qualities , but it must be emotional . It rests primarily on feeling . Wit , philosophy , moral truths , poetic language \u2014 all these count as nothing unless there is feeling of an obvious , ordinary kind .When reading a play aloud , do we give all the stage directions , or , cutting out those which state how certain speeches should be read , try to give these as directed ? Even when reading some story aloud , do we not often find troublesome full directions as to just how the speakers delivered their lines ? If given by us , they provide an awkward standard by which to judge our reading . If we wish to suppress them , they are not , in rapid reading , always seen in time . As was pointed out very early in this book , gesture , facial expression , movement about the stage , and above all , the voice , aid the dramatist as they cannot aid the novelist .

This space is often large enough for a man 's head . The Fool has seen the dancers make such a nut . Holding it up , he asks Pickle Herring what it is .

The whole Revesby Sword Play provides illustration after illustration of the inseparability of words and business in good dramatic dialogue . By \u201c business \u201d is meant ordinarily either illustrative action called for by a stage direction or clearly implied in the text . By \u201c latent business \u201d is meant the illustrative action which a sympathetic and imaginative producer finds in lines either ordinarily left without business or treated with some conventional action . Mr. William Poel 's historic revival of Everyman was crowded with such imaginative and richly interpretive business . When Death cried , Everyman , thou art mad ! Thou hast thy wits five , And here on earth will not amend thy life ! For suddenly I do come \u2014 on that last line he stretched out one arm and with the index finger of his hand barely touched the heart of Everyman . In the gesture there was a suggestion of what might be going to happen , even a suggestion that already Death thus claimed Everyman for his own . It pointed finely the immediate cry of Everyman , O wretched caitiff , whither shall I flee , That I might scape this endless sorrow ?The text did not call for this gesture : it belongs to the best type of interpretive business . Few untrained persons hear what they write : they merely see it . The skilled dramatist never forgets that he has to help him in his dialogue all that intonation , facial expression , gesture , and the general action of his characters may do for him . Which , after all , is the more touching , the cry of pleasure with which some child of the streets , at a charity Christmas tree , gazes at a rag doll some one holds out to her , or the silent mothering gesture with which she draws it close to her , her face alight ? It is just because , at times , facial expression , gesture , and movement may so completely express all that is needed that pantomime is coming to play a larger and larger part in our drama . Older readers of this book may recall the late Agnes Booth and her long silent scene in Jim , The Penman . By comparison of a letter and a cheque , Kate Ralston becomes aware that her husband is a famous forger , Jim , the Penman . Through all this great scene of an otherwise cheap play , the physical movement was very slight . The actress , three-quarters turned toward the audience , sat near a table . It was her facial expression and , rarely , a slight movement of the arms or body which conveyed her succession of increasingly intense emotions . The significant pantomime began with \u201c She puts cheque with others . \u201d The acting of the next seven lines of stage direction held an audience with increasing intensity of feeling for some five minutes . Ninahas just told her husband that she discovered Captain Redwood asleep in the conservatory at the end of Act I . Though she does not know it , this shows her husband that all his incriminating interview with Dr. Hartfeld may have been overheard . He falls into disturbed reverie and is so absorbed in thinking out the situation that he is oblivious to what she does ."]}, "act_index": 6, "play_index": 6}, {"data": {"454": ["What is this cheque ?

Yes , to be sure , you wrote the cheque . You asked permission to sign my name . How wonderfully like my writing ! Why , it quite deceives me , it 's so marvelous !The greatest recent instance of pantomime is undoubtedly the third scene of Act III of Mr. Galsworthy 's Justice . Set in Falder 's cell , it is meant to illustrate the loneliness , the excitability , and even the brutishness of a prisoner 's life . Many people , while admitting the effectiveness of this wordless scene , have declared it emotionally so overwhelming that they could not endure seeing it a second time . Falder 's cell , a whitewashed space thirteen feet broad by seven deep , and nine feet high , with a rounded ceiling . The floor is of shiny blackened bricks . The barred window of opaque glass with a ventilator , is high up in the middle of the end wall . In the middle of the opposite end wall is a narrow door . In a corner are the mattress and bedding rolled upAbove them is a quarter-circular wooden shelf , on which is a Bible and several little devotional books , piled in a symmetrical pyramid ; there are also a black hair-brush , tooth-brush , and a bit of soap . In another corner is the wooden frame of a bed , standing on end . There is a dark ventilator over the window , and another over the door . Falder 's workis hung to a nail on the wall over a small wooden table , on which the novel , \u201c Lorna Doone , \u201dlies open . Low down in the corner by the door is a thick glass screen , about a foot square , covering the gas-jet let into the wall . There is also a wooden stool , and a pair of shoes beneath it . Three bright round tins are set under the window . In the fast failing daylight , Falder , in his stockings , is seen standing motionless , with his head inclined towards the door , listening . He moves a little closer to the door , his stockinged feet making no noise . He stops at the door . He is trying harder and harder to hear something , any little thing that is going on outside . He springs suddenly upright \u2014 as if at a sound , and remains perfectly motionless . Then , with a heavy sigh , he moves to his work , and stands looking at it , with his head down ; he does a stitch or two , having the air of a man so lost in sadness that each stitch is , as it were , a coming to life . Then turning abruptly , he begins pacing the cell , moving his head , like an animal pacing its cage . He stops again at the door , listens , and , placing the palms of his hands against it with his fingers spread out , leans his forehead against the iron . Turning from it , presently , he moves slowly back towards the window , tracing his way with his finger along the top line of the distemper that runs round the wall . He stops under the window , and , picking up the lid of one of the tins , peers into it . It has grown very nearly dark . Suddenly the lid falls out of his hands with a clatter , the only sound that has broken the silence \u2014 and he stands staring intently at the wall where the stuff of the shirt is hanging rather white in the darkness \u2014 he seems to be seeing somebody or something there . There is a sharp tap and click ; the cell light behind the glass screen has been turned up . The cell is brightly lighted . Falder is seen gasping for breath . A sound from far away , as of distant , dull beating on thick metal , is suddenly audible . Falder shrinks back , not able to bear this sudden clamour . But the sound grows , as though some great tumbril were rolling towards the cell . And gradually it seems to hypnotise him . He begins creeping inch by inch nearer to the door . The banging sound , travelling from cell to cell , draws closer and closer ; Falder 's hands are seen moving as if his spirit had already joined in this beating , and the sound swells till it seems to have entered the very cell . He suddenly raises his clenched fists . Panting violently , he flings himself at his door , and beats on it . The curtain falls .Perhaps an even more interesting illustration of pantomime , because it gives us , instead of the heightening emotion of one person , the action of two characters upon each other , is found in Hugo von Hofmannsthal 's Die Frau im Fenster . She remains leaning over the parapet thus for a long time . Suddenly she thinks she hears something as the curtain behind her , separating her balcony from the room , is thrown open . Turning her head she sees her husband standing in the doorway . She springs up ; her features become distorted with the utmost anguish . Messer Braccio stands silent in the doorway . He wears a simple dark green dressing-gown , without weapons ; low shoes . He is very tall and strong . His face has the quality that often shows itself in the old pictures of great lords and condottieri . He has an exceedingly large forehead , and little , dark eyes , thick black hair , short and curly , and a small beard round his face . Dianora wishes to speak , but can bring no sound from her throat . Messer . Braccio motions for her to draw in the ladder . Dianora does so automatically , rolls it together , and as though unconscious , lets the bundle fall at her feet . Braccio regards her calmly . Then he grasps his left hip with his right hand , also with his left hand , and looking down , notes that he has no dagger . Making an impatient movement of the lips he glances down into the garden and behind him . He lifts his right hand for an instant and looks at its palm . He goes back into the room with firm , unhurried steps . Dianora looks after him continually ; she cannot take her eyes from him . When the curtain falls behind him , she passes her fingers over her cheeks and through her hair . Then she folds her hands and with wildly twitching lips silently prays . Then she throws her arms backward and grasps the stone coping with her fingers , a movement revealing firm resolution and a hint of triumph . Braccio steps out through the door again , carrying in his left hand a stool which he places in the doorway , and then sits down opposite his wife . His expression has not changed . From time to time he lifts his right hand mechanically and regards the small wound in its palm ."]}, "act_index": 6, "play_index": 6}, {"data": {"455": ["Palla degli Albizzi .Such elaborate pantomime as the cases just cited is naturally rare , but a dramatist is always watching for an opportunity to shorten by pantomime a speech or the dialogue of a scene , or to intensify by it the effect of his words .Is anything in Shore Acres , by James A. Herne , more memorable than the last scene ? In it Uncle Nat , who has established the happiness of the household , lights his candle deliberately and goes slowly up the long staircase to his bedroom , humming softly . He is the very picture of spiritual content . Words would have spoiled that scene as they have spoiled many and many a scene of an inexperienced dramatist .

Maldonado has left lying on her table a checkbook on a bank in which he has placed a few hundred pounds in her name . Because of the defalcation of her lawyer , she is in financial straits . Maldonado wishes to help her but also to gain power over her . Unwilling to take the checkbook , she has urged him to remove it . Lacking firmness of character , however , she lets him leave it , saying she will destroy it . With a troubled , half-guilty look , Iris attires herself in her hat and cape ; after which , carrying her gloves , she returns to her dressing-bag . Glancing round the room to assure herself that she has collected all her small personal belongings , her eyes rest on the checque-book which lies open on the writing-table .

Orestes !Curtain .Without question , then , speech in the drama may often give way in part or wholly to pantomime . The inexperienced dramatist should be constantly alert to see to what extent he can substitute it for dialogue .In all that has been said of pantomime , of course technical pantomime is not meant . The Commedia dell \u2019 arte , pantomime artists like the Ravel Brothers or Mme . Pilar-Morin , have a code of gesture to symbolize fixed meanings . What is meant here is the natural human pantomime of people whose faces and bodies portray or betray their feelings . Another word of warning in regard to pantomime . When a writer of plays once becomes well aware of the great value of pantomime , he is likely to overwork it . Assuming that the actor or actors may convey almost anything by physical movement , he trusts it too much . Let him who is for the moment under the spell of pantomime study the moving picture show . Pantomime may ordinarily convey physical action perfectly . Emotion naturally and easily expressed by action pantomime may convey , but when action for its clearness depends on knowledge of what is going on in the mind of the actor , pantomime begins to fail . Great artists like Mme . Pilar-Morin may carry us far even under these conditions , but most actors cannot . In a motion picture play like Cabiria , contrast the scenes in which the Roman and his slave flee before the crowd from part to part of the temple, or the scene of the terror of the wine merchantwith the scene in which the nurse meets the Roman and his slave on the wall of the city and begs their aid in saving the child , or the scenes in which Sophonisba struggles with her anxieties and mad desires . The second group of pictures without the explanations thrown on the screen would have little meaning . Pantomime is safe , not when it pleases us to use pantomime rather than to write dialogue , but when our characters naturally act rather than speak , or when we can devise for them natural action as clear as speech or clearer than speech . Use pantomime , but use it cautiously . Speech is the greatest emotional weapon of the dramatist . It best reveals emotion , and best of all creates responsive emotion . However , as most inexperienced dramatists use far too many words rather than too few , the value rather than the danger of pantomime should probably be stressed here . What seems natural , what makes for illusion , is the final test . It is this test of naturalness which has gradually excluded , except in special instances , the soliloquy and the aside . The general movement of drama in the past ten years has been toward better and better characterization in plays of all kinds . The newer melodrama and farce show us , not the mere comic puppets of the past , but people as real as the form represented \u2014 be it comedy , farce , tragedy , or melodrama \u2014 will permit . This new tendency has largely driven out the soliloquy and the aside . We should not , however , go to extremes , for occasionally we do swear under our breath or comment in asides , and as long as people do either , such people should be so represented . Moreover , we must admit that the insane , the demented , the invalid left much to himself , the hermit , whether of the woods or the hall bedroom in a city boarding house , do talk to themselves and often at great length . Neither the aside nor the soliloquy is , then , objectionable in itself . It is the use of either by persons who would probably use nothing of the sort , or their use in order to avoid exposition otherwise difficult which is to be decried . It is particularly this latter fault to which Sir Arthur Pinero calls attention when treating the faulty technique of R. L . Stevenson as a playwright : \u201c I will read you one of the many soliloquies \u2014 the faulty method of conducting action and revealing character by soliloquy was one from which Stevenson could never emancipate himself .

Give me joy \u2014 joy !In this once popular drama we have five asides close together , for of course \u201c to himself \u201d is the equivalent of an aside . All are bad , for in each case the other person on the stage must be supposed not to hear , and the aside is merely a device for telling us what the speaker is thinking . They vary in badness , however , for while Musgrave might well explain \u201c grilse \u201d to Anne as \u201c ammunition , \u201d he says , \u201c I have learned the key to their cipher , which I have copied from the priest 's letter , \u201d not as something which he is necessarily thinking at the time , but as something which the audience needs to know at this point . An aside is objectionable when a man speaks what he would be careful only to think , either because of the very nature of his thought or because somebody is near at hand who should not overhear . Asides should be kept for confidential remarks which may be made to some person standing near the speaker , but could not be heard by persons standing at a greater distance ; and to what naturally breaks from us in a moment of irritation , terror , or other strong emotion . Asides of the first group , confidential remarks , gain much in naturalness if spoken in half tones . Nothing could be more preposterous than the old stage custom of coming down to the footlights to tell an audience in clear-cut tones confidences which must not be overheard by people close at hand on the stage . Asides which are only brief soliloquies are little better . Asides in which the speaker merely says to the audience what he might perfectly well say to the people on the stage are foolish unless the author wishes to make the point that the character has the habit of talking to himself .

A drum lies on the floor beside him . Enter Benny , a bag over his shoulder . They salute each other and throughout use frequent military terms in their talk . Benny has just returned from the village and he gives an account of his trip and his purchases . Mention is made of the probable war with Spain . Benny then surprises Nat with a letter from Harold , which proves to contain an announcement that war has been declared and that Harold has enlisted . The two are proud and delighted at the thought of their hero . They recall his former discontent on the farm , the day of his departure to seek his fortune in the city , his statement that he was \u201c no soldier \u201d \u2014 now so gloriously disproved . Harold enters in the midst of their preparations for dinner . He is gaunt and shabby and has a nervous hunted air . He receives their plaudits sullenly . He explains that he is away on a week 's furlough and answers their questions concerning the regiment and his plans with nervous impatience .... In this next so-called scenario who is Professor Ward ? What is his relation to Phronie ? What is her age ? What is the age of Keith Sanford and what are the relations of each of these to Professor Ward himself ? A good list of dramatis personae would clear all this at once . THE EYES OF THE BLIND ACT I Professor Ward , roused at daybreak after a night at his desk , shows intense disappointment and nervous fatigue . In brief scene with Phronie , he shows the essential part she plays in his life as one on whom he can absolutely depend ; but when he expresses his disapproval of her admirer , Keith Sanford , she shows clear signs of rebellious spirit . In rapid scene with Phronie and Keith , their spirit of youthful romance is made clear ; and Keith indicates his college ambition , his predicament regarding his \u201c cribbed \u201d thesis , and his new attitude therein , ending with his evident resolve to make a clean breast of the matter .... There follows a scenario which is somewhat clearer than the others because it identifies the figures , but it certainly leaves their relations rather confused . An old white-haired man , the Sire de Maletroit , is seated in the chair to right of fireplace , in a listening attitude . The sound of a heavy door banging is heard and a minute later a young man , sword in hand , parts the curtains on left and stands blinking in the opening . He enters and explains that he has accidentally gained entrance to the house and is unable to re-open the door . His name is Denis de Beaulieu . He seems amazed to have the old man say that he has been waiting for him . Denis suggests that he must be going , at which the old man bursts into a fit of laughter . Denis is insulted and offers to hew the Maletroit 's door to pieces . He is convinced that this is folly ; the place is full of armed men . The old man rises , goes to door on right and calls upon his niece to leave her prayers and receive her lover . She comes in attended by a priest and protests that this is not the man . The uncle is incredulous and withdraws with a leer . Again a good list of dramatis personae would be helpful .

At the close she rises and walks toward the window , glancing hastily about to see that no one is in the room . As soon as the priest has left she draws from her breast a letter which she starts to read . She is soon interrupted by the entrance of her uncle the Sire de Maletroit , whose keen glance detects her hasty crumpling of the note which she has not had time to conceal . He greets her jovially and starts to walk hand in hand with her . Forcing open her hand , he finds the note , which he reads in a bitterly sarcastic tone , while Blanche stands transfixed with horror . It is a note asking her to leave the house door open at midnight so that the writer may enter and exchange words with her on the stairs . With cold sarcasm , ill concealing his rage , the Sire forces from her the story that a young captain has met her in church and given her the note . She denies that she knows his name , and the most violent threats will not induce her to tell it . She is then sent to her room to dress in sackcloth of repentance and told to prepare to spend the night in the chapel . THE SIRE DE MALETROIT 'S DOOR Persons represented The Sire de Maletroit .

That is very different . It would not be correct for a French girl to go about alone and speak to men as English and American girls do . That is why I so immensely admire the English people . You are so free \u2014 so unprejudiced \u2014 your women are so brave and frank \u2014 their minds are so \u2014 how do you say ?\u2014 wholesome . I intend to have my daughters educated in England . Nowhere else in the world but in England could I have met at a Variety Theatre a charming young lady of perfect respectability , and enjoyed a dance with her at a public dancing saloon . And where else are women trained to box and knock out the teeth of policemen as a protest against injustice and violence ?Your daughter , madam , is superb . Your country is a model to the rest of Europe . If you were a Frenchman , stifled with prudery , hypocrisy and the tyranny of the family and the home , you would understand how an enlightened Frenchman admires and envies your freedom , your broadmindedness , and the fact that home life can hardly be said to exist in England . You have made an end of the despotism of the parent ; the family council is unknown to you ; everywhere in these islands one can enjoy the exhilarating , the soul-liberating spectacle of men quarrelling with their brothers , defying their fathers , refusing to speak to their mothers . In France we are not men : we are only sons \u2014 grown-up children . Here one is a human being \u2014 an end in himself . Oh , Mrs Knox , if only your military genius were equal to your moral genius \u2014 if that conquest of Europe by France which inaugurated the new age after the Revolution had only been an English conquest , how much more enlightened the world would have been now ! We , alas , can only fight . France is unconquerable . We impose our narrow ideas , our prejudices , our obsolete institutions , our insufferable pedantry on the world by brute force \u2014 by that stupid quality of military heroism which shews how little we have evolved from the savage : nay , from the beast . We can charge like bulls ; we can spring on our foes like gamecocks ; when we are overpowered by reason , we can die fighting like rats . And we are foolish enough to be proud of it ! Why should we be ? Does the bull progress ? Can you civilize the gamecock ? Is there any future for the rat ? We cant even fight intelligently : when we lose battles , it is because we have not sense enough to know when we are beaten . At Waterloo , had we known when we were beaten , we should have retreated ; tried another plan ; and won the battle . But no : we were too pigheaded to admit that there is anything impossible to a Frenchman : we were quite satisfied when our Marshals had six horses shot under them , and our stupid old grognards died fighting rather than surrender like reasonable beings . Think of your great Wellington : think of his inspiring words , when the lady asked him whether British soldiers ever ran away . \u201c All soldiers run away , madam , \u201d he said ; \u201c but if there are supports for them to fall back on it does not matter . \u201d Think of your illustrious Nelson , always beaten on land , always victorious at sea , where his men could not run away . You are not dazzled and misled by false ideals of patriotic enthusiasm : your honest and sensible statesmen demand for England a two-power standard , even a three-power standard , frankly admitting that it is wise to fight three to one : whilst we , fools and braggarts as we are , declare that every Frenchman is a host in himself , and that when one Frenchman attacks three Englishmen he is guilty of an act of cowardice comparable to that of the man who strikes a woman . It is folly : it is nonsense : a Frenchman is not really stronger than a German , than an Italian , even than an Englishman . Sir : if all Frenchwomen were like your daughter \u2014 if all Frenchmen had the good sense , the power of seeing things as they really are , the calm judgment , the open mind , the philosophic grasp , the foresight and true courage , which are so natural to you as an Englishman that you are hardly conscious of possessing them , France would become the greatest nation in the world .", "Quite so .

We have had a somewhat agitating day : a valuable and innocent animal has lost its life : a public building has been wrecked : an aged and infirm lady has suffered an impact for which I feel personally responsible , though my old friend Mr Laurence Doyle unfortunately incurred the first effects of her very natural resentment . I greatly regret the damage to Mr Patrick Farrell 's fingers ; and I have of course taken care that he shall not suffer pecuniarily by his mishap .I am glad to say that Patsy took it like an Irishman , and , far from expressing any vindictive feeling , declared his willingness to break all his fingers and toes for me on the same termsGentlemen : I felt at home in Ireland from the firstIn every Irish breast I have found that spirit of liberty, that instinctive mistrust of the Government, that love of independence, that indignant sympathy with the cause of oppressed nationalities abroad, and with the resolute assertion of personal rights at home , which is all but extinct in my own country . If it were legally possible I should become a naturalized Irishman ; and if ever it be my good fortune to represent an Irish constituency in parliament , it shall be my first care to introduce a Bill legalizing such an operation . I believe a large section of the Liberal party would avail themselves of it .I do .Gentlemen : I have said enough .No : I have as yet no right to address you at all on political subjects ; and we must not abuse the warmhearted Irish hospitality of Miss Doyle by turning her sittingroom into a public meeting .", "I divined it , Larry : I saw it in their faces .

Afterwards , we shall see how we get on .", "A hypocrite !", "I shall never forget that with the chivalry of her nation , though I was utterly at her mercy , she refused me .", "You mean that it 's an act of treachery to Larry ?", "Oh well , do n't be too stand-offish , you know , Hodson .

It is a monster jaunting car , black and dilapidated , one of the last survivors of the public vehicles known to earlier generations as Beeyankiny cars , the Irish having laid violent tongues on the name of their projector , one Bianconi , an enterprising Italian . The three passengers are the parish priest , Father Dempsey ; Cornelius Doyle , Larry 's father ; and Broadbent , all in overcoats and as stiff as only an Irish car could make them . The priest , stout and fatherly , falls far short of that finest type of countryside pastor which represents the genius of priesthood ; but he is equally far above the base type in which a strongminded and unscrupulous peasant uses the Church to extort money , power , and privilege . He is a priest neither by vocation nor ambition , but because the life suits him . He has boundless authority over his flock , and taxes them stiffly enough to be a rich man . The old Protestant ascendency is now too broken to gall him . On the whole , an easygoing , amiable , even modest man as long as his dues are paid and his authority and dignity fully admitted . Cornelius Doyle is an elder of the small wiry type , with a hardskinned , rather worried face , clean shaven except for sandy whiskers blanching into a lustreless pale yellow and quite white at the roots . His dress is that of a country-town titan of business : that is , an oldish shooting suit , and elastic sided boots quite unconnected with shooting . Feeling shy with Broadbent , he is hasty , which is his way of trying to appear genial . Broadbent , for reasons which will appear later , has no luggage except a field glass and a guide book . The other two have left theirs to the unfortunate Patsy Farrell , who struggles up the hill after them , loaded with a sack of potatoes , a hamper , a fat goose , a colossal salmon , and several paper parcels . Cornelius leads the way up the hill , with Broadbent at his heels . The priest follows ; and Patsy lags laboriously behind .", "You may take it without offence from a madman who calls the ass his brother \u2014 and a very honest , useful and faithful brother too .

Can you deny these qualities and habits in yourself , sir ?", "How dar you , Patsy Farrell , put your own wicked little spites and foolishnesses into the heart of your priest ? For two pins I 'd tell him what you just said .", "You are satisfied ?", "It 's a priest 's business to notice everything . I wo n't tell you all I noticed about women ; but I 'll tell you this .

My pilgrimage to Rome taught me that walking is a better way of travelling than the train ; so I walked from Rome to the Sorbonne in Paris ; and I wish I could have walked from Paris to Oxford ; for I was very sick on the sea . After a year of Oxford I had to walk to Jerusalem to walk the Oxford feeling off me . From Jerusalem I came back to Patmos , and spent six months at the monastery of Mount Athos .

But this man did not complain of his misfortunes . They were brought upon him , he said , by sins committed in a former existence .

Hurry in now , Corny . Come , Mr Broadbent . I left the tea on the hob to draw ; and it 'll be black if we do n't go in an drink it . They go up the hill . It is dark by this time . Broadbent does not fare so badly after all at Aunt Judy 's board . He gets not only tea and bread-and-butter , but more mutton chops than he has ever conceived it possible to eat at one sitting . There is also a most filling substance called potato cake . Hardly have his fears of being starved been replaced by his first misgiving that he is eating too much and will be sorry for it tomorrow , when his appetite is revived by the production of a bottle of illicitly distilled whisky , called pocheen , which he has read and dreamed ofand is now at last to taste . His good humor rises almost to excitement before Cornelius shows signs of sleepiness . The contrast between Aunt Judy 's table service and that of the south and east coast hotels at which he spends his Fridays-to-Tuesdays when he is in London , seems to him delightfully Irish . The almost total atrophy of any sense of enjoyment in Cornelius , or even any desire for it or toleration of the possibility of life being something better than a round of sordid worries , relieved by tobacco , punch , fine mornings , and petty successes in buying and selling , passes with his guest as the whimsical affectation of a shrewd Irish humorist and incorrigible spendthrift . Aunt Judy seems to him an incarnate joke . The likelihood that the joke will pall after a month or so , and is probably not apparent at any time to born Rossculleners , or that he himself unconsciously entertains Aunt Judy by his fantastic English personality and English mispronunciations , does not occur to him for a moment . In the end he is so charmed , and so loth to go to bed and perhaps dream of prosaic England , that he insists on going out to smoke a cigar and look for Nora Reilly at the Round Tower . Not that any special insistence is needed ; for the English inhibitive instinct does not seem to exist in Rosscullen . Just as Nora 's liking to miss a meal and stay out at the Round Tower is accepted as a sufficient reason for her doing it , and for the family going to bed and leaving the door open for her , so Broadbent 's whim to go out for a late stroll provokes neither hospitable remonstrance nor surprise . Indeed Aunt Judy wants to get rid of him whilst she makes a bed for him on the sofa . So off he goes , full fed , happy and enthusiastic , to explore the valley by moonlight . The Round Tower stands about half an Irish mile from Rosscullen , some fifty yards south of the road on a knoll with a circle of wild greensward on it . The road once ran over this knoll ; but modern engineering has tempered the level to the Beeyankiny car by carrying the road partly round the knoll and partly through a cutting ; so that the way from the road to the tower is a footpath up the embankment through furze and brambles . On the edge of this slope , at the top of the path , Nora is straining her eyes in the moonlight , watching for Larry . At last she gives it up with a sob of impatience , and retreats to the hoary foot of the tower , where she sits down discouraged and cries a little . Then she settles herself resignedly to wait , and hums a song \u2014 not an Irish melody , but a hackneyed English drawing-room ballad of the season before last \u2014 until some slight noise suggests a footstep , when she springs up eagerly and runs to the edge of the slope again . Some moments of silence and suspense follow , broken by unmistakable footsteps . She gives a little gasp as she sees a man approaching .", "Ah galong ! How can you like what 's not natural ? I hope you slept well .", "Hip hip hurray !

Do you know , I 'm rather glad I 'm not literary or artistic myself ; it seems to make people so queer-looking , somehow . Oh , of course I did n't mean you looked queer \u2014 but generally , you know . You 've made quite a success with your Andromeda , have n't you ? I only go by what I 'm told \u2014 I do n't read much myself . We women have so many really serious matters to attend to \u2014 arranging about dinners , and visits , and trying on frocks , and then rushing about from party to party .

UndershellThere is no doubt about it ; bright , independent girl ; gloves a trifle worn ; travels second-class for economy ; it must be Miss Mull herself ; her letter mentioned Lady Culverin as her aunt . A poor relation , probably . She does n't suspect that I am \u2014\u2014 I wo n't reveal myself just yet ; better let it dawn upon her gradually .Why , I was only about to say , why then you must be going to the same house as I am . How extremely fortunate a coincidence ! His Fellow Passenger . That remains to be seen .What a funny little man ; such a flowery way of talking for a footman . Oh , but I forgot ; he said he was n't going to wear livery . Well , he would look a sight in it ! PART V CROSS PURPOSES In a First-class Compartment . Lady MaisiePoets do n't seem to have much self-possession . He seems perfectly overcome by hearing my name like that . If only he does n't lose his head completely and say something about my wretched letter ! SpurrellI 'd better tell \u2018 em before they find out for themselves .My lady , I \u2014 I feel I ought to explain at once how I come to be going down to Wyvern like this .Lady CantireMy good sir , there 's not the slightest necessity ; I am perfectly aware of who you are , and everything about you ! SpurrellBut really I do n't see how your ladyship \u2014\u2014 Why , I have n't said a word that \u2014\u2014 Lady CantireCelebrities who mean to preserve their incognito should n't allow their friends to see them off . I happened to hear a certain Andromeda mentioned , and that was quite enough for Me ! SpurrellShe knows ; seen the sketch of me in the Dog Fancier , I expect ; goes in for breeding bulls herself , very likely . Well , that 's a load off my mind !You do n't say so , my lady . I 'd no idea your ladyship would have any taste that way ; most agreeable surprise to me , I can assure you !", "I know I must seem unduly expansive , and wanting in reserve ; and yet that is not my true disposition . In general , I feel an almost fastidious shrinking from strangers \u2014\u2014 PhillipsonReally ? I should n't have thought it !", "They know ! Then there 's no time to be lost . I must leave this moment !", "Have you , though ?I hope he wo n't be fidgety with his hind-legs . I shall stay outside .", "One horse will be quite sufficient . Very well , then . I 'll just run up and get my portmanteau , and \u2014 and one or two things of mine , and if you will be round at the back entrance \u2014 do n't trouble to drive up to the front door \u2014 as soon as possible , I wo n't keep you waiting longer than I can help . Good evening , Mr. Adams , and many thanks .I 've got out of that rather well . Now , I 've only to find my way to the Verney Chamber , see this fellow Spurrell , and get my clothes back , and then I can retreat with comfort , and even dignity ! These Culverins shall learn that there is at least one poet who will not put up with their insolent patronage ! CheckleyHe has got a cool cheek , and no mistake ! But if he waits to be druv over to Shuntingbridge till I come round for him , he 'll \u2018 ave to set on that portmanteau of his a goodish time !", "I might \u2014 if I had any desire to make an unnecessary and insulting remark .", "But why ? Not because they appreciate my work \u2014 which they probably only half understand \u2014 but out of mere idle curiosity to see what manner of strange beast a Poet may be ! And I do n't know this Lady Culverin \u2014 never met her in my life ! What the deuce does she mean by sending me an invitation ? Why should these smart women suppose that they are entitled to send for a Man of Genius , as if he was their lackey ? Answer me that !", "To be quite frank , I did n't trouble myself about him : my sole object was to retreat with dignity ; he had got himself somehow or other into a false position he must get out of as best he could . After all , he would be none the worse for having filled my place for a few hours . Lady MaisieI see . It did n't matter to you whether he was suspected of being an impostor , or made to feel uncomfortable , or \u2014 or anything . Was n't that a little unfeeling of you ?", "Candidly , Lady Maisie , I can n't affect a very keen interest in the \u2014 er \u2014 gossip of the housekeeper 's room . Indeed , I am rather surprised that you should condescend to listen to \u2014\u2014 Lady MaisieThis is really too much !It never occurred to me that I was \u201c condescending \u201d in taking an interest in a pretty and wayward girl who happens to be my maid . But then , I 'm not a Democrat , Mr. Blair .", "I really do n't know how I can have given you that impression . If you expect me to treat my lyre like a horse-collar , and grin through it , I 'm afraid I am unable to gratify you . SteptoeCapital , sir , the professional allusion very neat . You 'll come out presently , I can see , when supper 's on the table . Ca n't expect you to rattle till you 've something inside of you , can we ?", "Then tell Thomas , with my compliments , that he will trouble himself to pack it again immediately .", "I am leaving immediately , and \u2014 and I do n't wish Sir Rupert or Lady", "You are a cynic , I observe , sir . But possibly the nature of the business which brings you here renders them \u2014\u2014", "It 's not at all necessary that you should make it out .", "I do n't say that I may not have another reason \u2014 a \u2014 a rather romantic one \u2014 but you would only sneer if I told you ! I know you think me a poor creature whose head has been turned by an undeserved success .", "Man alive ! do you imagine anything would induce me to meet them now , after the humiliations I have been compelled to suffer under this roof ?", "You will hear a good deal about it , unless it is forthcoming at once .

Miss SpelwaneNot Clarion Blair ! Not even a poet ! I \u2014 I could slap him ! PillinerPoor dear Vivien ! But if people will insist on patting a strange poet , they must n't be surprised if they get a nasty bite ! Lady MaisieHe did n't write Andromeda ! Then he has n't got my letter after all ! And I 've been such a brute to the poor dear man ! How lucky I said nothing about it to Gerald ! Captain ThicknesseSo he ai n't the bard !... Now I see why Maisie 's been behavin \u2019 so oddly all the evenin \u2019 ; she spotted him , and did n't like to speak out . Tried to give me a hint , though . Well , I shall stay out my leave now ! Lady RhodaI thought all along he seemed too good a sort for a poet ! ArchieIt 's all very well ; but how about that skit he went up to write on us ? He must be a poet of sorts .", "Well , if you say so , of course \u2014\u2014 But it looked rather like it , asking me to read when I 've about as much poetry in me as \u2014 as a pot hat ! Still , if I 'm wanted to read aloud , I shall be happy to \u2014\u2014 Lady CulverinIndeed , indeed , Mr. Spurrell , we could n't think of troubling you any more under the circumstances !Vivien , my dear , wo n't you sing something ?SpurrellWonder what 's put them off being read to all of a sudden ? My elocution may n't be first-class , exactly , but still \u2014\u2014Hullo ! This cover 's pink , with silver things , not unlike cutlets , on it ! Did n't Emma ask me \u2014\u2014? By George , if it 's that ! I may get down to the housekeeper 's room , after all ! As soon as ever this squalling stops I 'll find out ; I can n't go on like this !Better wait till these county nobs have cleared , I suppose \u2014 there goes the last of \u2018 em \u2014 now for it !...Hem , Sir Rupert , and your ladyship , it 's occurred to me that it 's just barely possible you may have got it in your heads that I was something in the poetical way . Sir RupertNot this poor young chap 's fault ; must let him down as easily as possible !Not at all \u2014 not at all ! Ha \u2014 assure you we quite understand ; no necessity to say another word about it . SpurrellJust my luck ! They quite understand ! No housekeeper 's room for me this journey !Of course I knew the Countess , there , and Lady Maisie , were fully aware all along \u2014\u2014You were , were n't you ? Lady MaisieYes , yes , Mr. Spurrell . Of course ! It 's all perfectly right ! SpurrellYou see , I should never have thought of coming in as a visitor if it had n't been for the Countess ; she would have it that it was all right , and that I need n't be afraid I should n't be welcome .", "But indeed , my lady , I \u2014 I think I 'd better wait till she sends for me .", "Well , I do n't say I may n't have got a certain amount of what they call \u201c kudosh , \u201d owing to Andromeda . But what difference does that make ?", "That 's all right , then . All I do n't know about dogs and horses you could put in a homoeopathic globule \u2014 and then it would rattle !", "Well , I was going to call her Sal ; but a chap at the College thought the other would look more stylish if I ever meant to exhibit her . Andromeda was one of them Roman goddesses , you know .", "If your ladyship does n't really know , you had better ask", "Not at this moment . But I 'd soon put my soul above a sherry and bitters if I got a chance ! Captain ThicknesseI say , you know , that 's rather smart , eh ?Aw'fly clever sort of chap , this , but not stuck up \u2014 not half a bad sort , if he is a bit of a bounder .Anythin \u2019 in the evenin \u2019 paper ? Do n't get \u2018 em down here .", "They 're not more cramped than they ought to be ; she never turned them in , you know ! Miss SpelwaneI did n't suppose she did .

But how was I to know ? You should n't leave your things about like that !", "Well , if you 'd only tell me what I ought to do !", "I do n't say it is n't gratifying to be treated like a swell , but I 've got my professional reputation to consider , you know ; and if they 're going to take up all my time talking about Andromeda \u2014\u2014 UndershellAndromeda !

If you could spare \u2018 em a bit longer , I 'd be no end obliged . Because , you see , I promised Lady Rhoda to come and finish a talk we were having , and they 've taken away my own things to brush , so I have n't a rag to go down in except these ; and they 'd all think it so beastly rude if I went to bed now ! UndershellI tell you you may keep them , if you 'll only go away !", "Excuse me , my lady , not Blair \u2014 Spurrell .", "I 'm no wiser than your ladyship there . All I know is he said he would n't take it off till he saw me . And I never saw any one in such a mess with ink and flour as he was !", "Well , you do put some heart into me , Lady Maisie . I feel equal to the lot of \u2018 em now ! PillinerIs that the poet ? Why , but I say \u2014 he 's a fraud ! Where 's his matted head ? He 's not a bit ragged , or rusty either . And why do n't he dabble ? Do n't seem to know what to do with his hands quite , though , does he ? Miss SpelwaneHe knows how to do some very exquisite poetry with one of them , at all events . I 've been reading it , and I think it perfectly marvellous !", "Oh , rabbits be blowed !I wanted you to see that notice they put in of Andromeda and me , with my photo and all ; it said she was the best bull-bitch they 'd seen for many a day , and fully deserved her first prize .", "Well , it 's no business of mine ; you 've behaved devilish well to me , and I 'm not surprised that you 'd rather not be seen in the state you 're in . I should n't like it myself !", "I assure you , I did n't go a step beyond the most ordinary civility . You 're not going to be jealous because I promised I 'd give her a liniment for one of her dogs , are you ?", "I never saw any in Andromeda myself , your \u2014 your Holiness . You 're the first to find a fault in her . I do n't say there may n't be something dicky about the setting and the turn of the tail , but that 's a trifle .", "Oh , the girl I sat next to at dinner ? Nice chatty sort of girl ; seems fond of quadrupeds \u2014\u2014", "That 's the rummest thing about it . I have n't heard a word about that yet . I 'm in the veterinary profession , you know . Well , they sent for me to see some blooming horse , and never even ask me to go near it ! Seems odd , do n't it ? UndershellI had to go near the blooming horse ! Now I begin to understand ; the very servants did not expect to find a professional vet in any company but their own !I \u2014 I trust that the horse will not suffer through any delay .", "I have got on . I am now a qualified M. R. C. V. S .", "Lady Maisie", "You must give me time to get out of this toggery , old chap ; you 'll have to pick me out of it like a lobster ! UndershellThe clothes ? Never mind them now . I can n't wait . Keep them !", "Oh , as for that , there is rather a run on me just now , but I put everything else aside for you , of course !

I do n't know what you and Albinia and Maisie may know that I am in ignorance of , but , since you seem to have been aware from the first that Mr. Spurrell was not the poet you had invited here to meet me , will you kindly explain what has become of the real author ?", "Nonsense , my dear , no walk at all ; the church is only just across the park . My brother Rupert always goes , and it pleases him to see the Wyvern pew as full as possible . I seldom feel equal to going myself , because I find the necessity of allowing pulpit inaccuracies to pass without a protest gets too much on my nerves ; but my daughter will accompany you .

If Mr. Spurrell is not Clarion Blair , let him explain how he came to be coming down to Wyvern this afternoon !", "Ink and flour , indeed ! This rigmarole gets more ridiculous every moment ! You can n't seriously expect any one here to believe it !", "I wonder , Bishop , if you have seen this wonderful volume of poetry that every one is talking about \u2014 Andromeda ? The BishopI chanced only this morning , by way of momentary relaxation , to take up a journal containing a notice of that work , with copious extracts . The impression left on my mind was \u2014 ah \u2014 unfavourable ; a certain talent , no doubt , some felicity of expression , but a noticeable lack of the \u2014 ah \u2014 reticence , the discipline , the \u2014 the scholarly touch which a training at one of our great Public Schools, and at a University , can alone impart . I was also pained to observe a crude discontent with the existing Social System \u2014 a system which , if not absolutely perfect , cannot be upset or even modified without the gravest danger . But I was still more distressed to note in several passages a decided taint of the morbid sensuousness which renders so much of our modern literature sickly and unwholesome .", "Maisie , there 's quite a clever little notice in Society Snippets about the dance at Skympings last week . I 'm sure I wonder how they pick up these things ; it quite bears out what I was told ; says the supper arrangements were \u201c simply disgraceful ; not nearly enough champagne ; and what there was , undrinkable ! \u201d So like poor dear Lady Chesepare ; never does do things like anybody else .

She took it without saying thank you , because she was a lady and he wasn \u2019 t a gentleman .

Have you ever known a woman of fashion who sends her maid to bed when she knows she won \u2019 t be in till four in the morning ? Not much . And is there anything like the insolence with which a woman treats her social inferiors of the same sex ? Is it men who put on their backs the sealskins that are torn off the living bodies of helpless brutes ? Is it men who put on their hats the beautiful birds of the forest ? It \u2019 s the gentle sex . Boys are taught manners . They are taught to take off their hats and hold open the door for their sisters .

This ring , in fact , was the cause of these discoveries being made .

Hence the discovery has been made that it was Philumena ravished by him , and that this new-born child is his . I am overjoyed that this happiness has befallen him through my agency ; although other courtesans would not have similar feelings ; nor , indeed , is it to our interest that any lover should find pleasure in matrimony .

How does it strike you ?", "Have a cigar ?", "A little preoccupied .", "No .", "Then we have a good deal in common , Mr. Madison , for I also count Miss Murdock a friend , and when two friends of a friend have the pleasure of meeting , I dare say that 's a pretty good foundation for them to become friends too .", "No ; head too big .Tastes like punk .", "Of course you told him about the letter , and how it was burned up , and all that sort of thing , did n't you ?", "Never have made it , have you ?", "Yes , the very first thing you did was to lose your temper . Now people who always lose their temper will never make a lot of money , and you admit that that is a great necessity \u2014 I mean now \u2014 to you .", "What 's his business ?", "Going \u2014 er \u2014 to get married ?", "What kind ?", "Well , she ought to be here .", "A wire .", "Any difference from the many you have known ?", "Yes , it 's been a mighty good two years for me . I was always proud to take you around , because I think you one of the prettiest things in New York, and that helps some , and you 're always jolly , and you never complained . You always spent a lot of money , but it was a pleasure to see you spend it ; and then you never offended me . Most women offend men by coming around looking untidy and sort of unkempt , but somehow you always knew the value of your beauty , and you always dressed up . I always thought that maybe some day the fellow would come along , grab you , and make you happy in a nice way , but I thought that he 'd have to have a lot of money . You know you 've lived a rather extravagant life for five years , Laura . It wo n't be an easy job to come down to cases and suffer for the little dainty necessities you 've been used to .", "Going away ?", "Not what you are going to do for him \u2014 what am I going to do for him .

The truth is never gentle .Most conditions in life are unpleasant , and , if you want to meet them squarely , you have got to realize the unpleasant point of view . That 's the only way you can fight them and win . JOHNStill , I believe Laura means what she says , in spite of all you say and the disagreeable logic of it . I think she loves me . If she should ever want to go back to the old way of getting along , I think she 'd tell me so . So you see , Brockton , all your talk is wasted , and we 'll drop the subject .", "Show me that telegram !", "If she leaves you first , you are to tell me , and if she comes to me I 'll make her let you know just when and why . JOHN is leaning on arm , facing WILL ; his hand shoots out in a gesture of warning to WILL .", "Where is it ?", "We 'll have to cut out those parties . I can n't do those things any more . I 'm not as young as I was , and in the morning it makes me sick . How do you feel ?", "I 'm mighty glad of that , Laura . I 've missed you like the very devil .", "What 's the game ?", "Oh , do n't get sentimental . If you 're going to bring up that sort of talk , Laura , do it sometime when I have n't got a hang-over , and then do n't forget talk never does count for much . LAURA crosses up to mirror , picks up hat from box , puts it on , looks in mirror . She turns around and looks at him steadfastly for a minute . During this entire scene , from the time the curtain rises , she must in a way indicate a premonition of an approaching catastrophe , a feeling , vague but nevertheless palpable , that something is going to happen . She must hold this before her audience so that she can show to them , without showing to him , the disgust she feels . LAURA has tasted of the privations of self-sacrifice during her struggle , and she has weakly surrendered and is unable to go back , but that brief period of self-abnegation has shown to her most clearly the rottenness of the other sort of living . There are enough sentimentality and emotion in her character to make it impossible for her to accept this manner of existence as ELFIE does . Hers is not a nature of careless candour , but of dreamy ideals and better living , warped , handicapped , disillusioned , and destroyed by a weakness that finds its principal force in vanity . WILL resumes his newspaper in a more attentive way . The girl looks at him and expresses in pantomime , by the slightest gesture or shrug of the shoulders , her growing distaste for him and his way of living . In the meantime WILL is reading the paper rather carefully . He stops suddenly and then looks at his watch .", "What did you do with it ?", "On thirty dollars a week ?", "How ?", "I know . I guess there 's enough therefor your immediate needs . Later you can straighten things up . Shall I send the car ?", "Yourself .", "Why , I guess so . If I was perfectly confident that this new arrangement was going to result happily for you both , I think it would be great , only I 'm somewhat doubtful , for when people become serious and then fail , I know how hard those things hit , having been hit once myself .", "Thank you .", "Oh ! He makes himself rather comfortable in the chair , and LAURA regards him for a moment from up stage as if trying to figure out how to get rid of him .", "Annie , Annie !Annie !Where the devil is that nigger ?", "What 's his name ?", "Ever been to New York before ?", "How soon do you expect him back ?", "That depends .", "You 're foolish .", "All right .", "Man ?", "Laura , run into the house and see if Mrs. Williams has won another quarter .Madison and I are going to smoke a cigar and have a friendly chat , and when we get through I think we 'll both be better off .", "Oh ! ANNIE re\u00ebnters with a time-table and hands it to LAURA .", "You have had that idea before . Every woman 's love is the real one when it comes .Do you make a distinction in this case , young lady ?", "Feel like quitting ?", "How are you going to support her ? Her cabs cost more than your salary , and she pays her week 's salary for an every-day walking-hat . She 's always had a maid ; her simplest gown flirts with a hundred-dollar note ; her manicurist and her hair-dresser will eat up as much as you pay for your board . She never walks when it 's stormy , and every afternoon there 's her ride in the park . She dines at the best places in New York , and one meal costs her more than you make in a day . Do you imagine for a moment that she 's going to sacrifice these luxuries for any great length of time ?", "Up the road there . On that yellow horse .", "Well , Laura .", "Then you 've lied again . You lied to him , and you just tried to lie to me now . I must say , Laura , that you 're not particularly clever at it , although I do n't doubt but that you 've had considerable practice .

He was a pretty fresh young man and did an awful lot of talking . I wonder how he 's doing and how he 's getting along . I do n't suppose by any chance you have ever heard from him ?", "Well , I 'm damned if he has n't done what he said he 'd do \u2014 see !He 's been in Chicago , and is on his way to New York .

He continues on his way ; he opens the door , leaves it open , and passes on to the outer door , which he opens .

He comes in , slamming the outer door with effect , which one must have at this point of the play , because it is essential to a situation coming later .

He goes over to her . She intuitively understands that she is about to go through an ordeal . She seems to feel that JOHN has become acquainted with something which might interfere with their plan .

I can n't tell you , Will , how much different it is , but everything I felt before seems so sort of earthly \u2014 and somehow this love that I have for this man is so different . It 's made me want to be truthful and sincere and humble for the first time in my life . The only other thing I ever had that I cared the least bit about , now that I look back , was your friendship . We have been good pals , have n't we ?", "Then everything is settledjust the way it ought to be \u2014 frankly and aboveboard ?", "But I 've got what you have n't got .

I do n't love anyone in the world but just you . I know you do n't think that it can be explained \u2014 maybe there is n't any explanation . I could n't help it . I was so poor , and I had to live , and he would n't let me work , and he 's only let me live one way , and I was hungry . Do you know what that means ?

And so , when Arbaces , who was one of the generals under him , a Mede by birth , endeavoured to manage by the assistance of one of the eunuchs , whose name was Sparamizus , to see Sardanapalus : and when ... he saw him painted with vermilion , and adorned like a woman , sitting among his concubines , carding purple wool , and sitting among them with his feet up , wearing a woman 's robe , and with his beard carefully scraped , and his face smoothed with pumice stoneMost historians , of whom Duris is one , relate that Arbaces , being indignant at his countrymen being ruled over by such a monarch as that , stabbed him and slew him . But Ctesias says that he went to war with him , and collected a great army , and then that Sardanapalus , being dethroned by Arbaces , died , burning himself alive in his palace , having heaped up a funeral pile four plethra in extent , on which he placed 150 golden couches . \u201d \u2014 The Deipnosophist\u00e6 ... of Athen\u00e6us , bk . xii . c. 38 , translated by C.

He resolved , however , to die in such a manner as , according to his opinion , should cover the infamy of his scandalous and effeminate life . He ordered a pile of wood to be made in his palace , and , setting fire to it , burnt himself , his eunuchs , his women , and his treasures .\u2014 Diod . Sic ., Bibl .

So that it could neither be truth nor satire on any living monarch . \u201d \u2014 Letter to Murray , May 25 , 1821 , Letters , 1901 , v. 299 . Byron pretended , or , perhaps , really thought , that such a phrase as the \u201c Queen 's wrongs \u201d would be supposed to contain an allusion to the trial of Queen Caroline, and to the exclusion of her name from the State prayers , etc . Unquestionably if the play had been put on the stage at this time , the pit and gallery would have applauded the sentiment to the echo . There was , too , but one \u201c pavilion \u201d in 1821 , and that was not on the banks of the Euphrates , but at Brighton . Qui s'excuse s'accuse . Byron was not above \u201c paltering \u201d with his readers \u201c in a double sense . \u201d ]{ 16 } \u201c The Ionian name had been still more comprehensive ; having included the Achaians and the B\u0153otians , who , together with those to whom it was afterwards confined , would make nearly the whole of the Greek nation ; and among the Orientals it was always the general name for the Greeks . \u201d \u2014 MITFORD 'S Greece , 1818. i . 199 .{ 17 } To Byblis \u2014\u2014.\u2014I know each glance of those deep Greek-souled eyes .\u2014{ 19 } \u2014\u2014 I have a mind To curse the restless slaves with their own wishes .\u2014{ 21 }He did , and thence was deemed a God in story .\u2014throws some doubt on the existence of these columns , which he suggests were islands or \u201c pillar \u201d rocks . According to Plutarch, Alexander built great altars on the banks of the Ganges , on which the native kings were wont to \u201c offer sacrifices in the Grecian manner . \u201d Hence , perhaps , the legend of the columns erected by Dionysus . ]\u201c For this expedition he took only a small chosen body of the phalanx , but all his light troops . In the first day 's march he reached Anchialus , a town said to have been founded by the king of Assyria , Sardanapalus . The fortifications , in their magnitude and extent , still in Arrian 's time , bore the character of greatness , which the Assyrians appear singularly to have affected in works of the kind . A monument representing Sardanapalus was found there , warranted by an inscription in Assyrian characters , of course in the old Assyrian language , which the Greeks , whether well or ill , interpreted thus : \u2018 Sardanapalus , son of Anacyndaraxes , in one day founded Anchialus and Tarsus . Eat , drink , play ; all other human joys are not worth a fillip . \u2019 Supposing this version nearly exact, whether the purpose has not been to invite to civil order a people disposed to turbulence , rather than to recommend immoderate luxury , may perhaps reasonably be questioned . What , indeed , could be the object of a king of Assyria in founding such towns in a country so distant from his capital , and so divided from it by an immense extent of sandy deserts and lofty mountains , and , still more , how the inhabitants could be at once in circumstances to abandon themselves to the intemperate joys which their prince has been supposed to have recommended , is not obvious . But it may deserve observation that , in that line of coast , the southern of Lesser Asia , ruins of cities , evidently of an age after Alexander , yet barely named in history , at this day astonish the adventurous traveller by their magnificence and elegance amid the desolation which , under a singularly barbarian government , has for so many centuries been daily spreading in the finest countries of the globe . Whether more from soil and climate , or from opportunities for commerce , extraordinary means must have been found for communities to flourish there ; whence it may seem that the measures of Sardanapalus were directed by juster views than have been commonly ascribed to him . But that monarch having been the last of a dynasty ended by a revolution , obloquy on his memory would follow of course from the policy of his successors and their partisans . The inconsistency of traditions concerning Sardanapalus is striking in Diodorus 's account of him . \u201d \u2014 MITFORD 's Greece , 1820 , ix . 311-313 , and note 1 ., and as follows by Athen\u00e6usin the Deipnosophist\u00e6 : \u201c And Aristobulus says , \u2018 In Anchiale , which was built by Sardanapalus , did Alexander , when he was on his expedition against the Persians , pitch his camp . And at no great distance was the monument of Sardanapalus , on which there is a marble figure putting together the fingers of its right hand , as if it were giving a fillip . And there was on it the following inscription in Assyrian characters :\u2014 Sardanapalus The king , and son of Anacyndaraxes , In one day built Anchiale and Tarsus : Eat , drink , and love , the rest 's not worth e'en this . \u2019 By \u2018 this \u2019 meaning the fillip he was giving with his fingers . \u201d \u201c We may conjecture , \u201d says Canon Rawlinson , \u201c that the monument was in reality a stele containing the kingin an arched frame , with the right hand raised above the left , which is the ordinary attitude , and an inscription commemorating the occasion of its erection \u201d\u2014 The Five Great Monarchies , etc ., 1871 , ii . 216 . ]{ 25 }{ 27 }Compare \u2014 \u201c I have not flattered its rank breath . \u201d Childe Harold , Canto III . stanza cxiii . line 2 .

He replied in these words \u2014 \u201c Edinburgh , 4th December , 1821 . \u201c My Dear Sir ,\u2014 I accept , with feelings of great obligation , the flattering proposal of Lord Byron to prefix my name to the very grand and tremendous drama of \u2018 Cain . \u2019I may be partial to it , and you will allow I have cause ; but I do not know that his Muse has ever taken so lofty a flight amid her former soarings . He has certainly matched Milton on his own ground . Some part of the language is bold , and may shock one class of readers , whose line will be adopted by others out of affectation or envy . But then they must condemn the \u2018 Paradise Lost , \u2019 if they have a mind to be consistent . The fiend-like reasoning and bold blasphemy of the fiend and of his pupil lead exactly to the point which was to be expected ,\u2014 the commission of the first murder , and the ruin and despair of the perpetrator . \u201c I do not see how any one can accuse the author himself of Manicheism . The Devil talks the language of that sect , doubtless ; because , not being able to deny the existence of the Good Principle , he endeavours to exalt himself \u2014 the Evil Principle \u2014 to a seeming equality with the Good ; but such arguments , in the mouth of such a being , can only be used to deceive and to betray . Lord Byron might have made this more evident , by placing in the mouth of Adam , or of some good and protecting spirit , the reasons which render the existence of moral evil consistent with the general benevolence of the Deity . The great key to the mystery is , perhaps , the imperfection of our own faculties , which see and feel strongly the partial evils which press upon us , but know too little of the general system of the universe , to be aware how the existence of these is to be reconciled with the benevolence of the great Creator . \u201c To drop these speculations , you have much occasion for some mighty spirit , like Lord Byron , to come down and trouble the waters ; for , excepting \u2018 The John Bull , \u2019you seem stagnating strangely in London . \u201c Yours , my dear Sir , \u201c Very truly , \u201c WALTER SCOTT . \u201c To John Murray , Esq . \u201d -Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott , by J. G. Lockhart , Esq ., 1838 , iii . 92 , 93 .\u201c However , the praise often given to Byron has been so exaggerated as to provoke , perhaps , a reaction in which he is unduly disparaged . \u2018 As various in composition as Shakespeare himself , Lord Byron has embraced , \u2019 says Sir Walter Scott , \u2018 every topic of human life , and sounded every string on the divine harp , from its slightest to its most powerful and heart-astounding tones .... In the very grand and tremendous drama of Cain , \u2019 etc .... \u2018 And Lord Byron has done all this , \u2019 Scott adds , \u2018 while managing his pen with the careless and negligent ease of a man of quality . \u2019 \u201d \u2014 Poetry of Byron , chosen and arranged by Matthew Arnold , 1881 , p. xiii . Scott does not add anything of the kind . The comparison with Shakespeare was written after Byron 's death in May , 1824 ; the appreciation of Cain in December , 1821; while the allusion to \u201c a man of quality \u201d is to be found in an article contributed to the Quarterly Review in 1816 ! ]The first number of John Bull , \u201c For God , the King , and the People , \u201d was published Sunday , December 17 , 1820 . Theodore Hook was the editor , and it is supposed that he owed his appointment to the intervention of Sir Walter Scott . The raison d'\u00eatre of John Bull was to write up George IV ., and to write down Queen Caroline . \u201c The national movementwas arrested ; and George IV . had mainly John Bull to thank for that result . \u201d \u2014 A Sketch ,, 1852 , p . 45 . ]]{ 207 }, printed in Stevens 's continuation of Dugdale 's Monasticon , 1722 , i . 139-153 . There is a sixteenth-century edition of Le Mist\u00e8re du Viel Testament , which was reprinted by the Baron James de Rothschild , in 1878; but it is improbable that it had come under Byron 's notice .

According to his own story, \u201c I determined to study nothing but my Bible .... I had no prejudice against , no predilection for , the Church of England , but a sincere regard for the Church of Christ , and an insuperable objection to every degree of dogmatical intolerance . I never troubled myself with answering any arguments which the opponents in the Divinity Schools brought against the articles of the Church , ... but I used on such occasions to say to them , holding the New Testament in my hand , \u2018 En sacrum codicem ! Here is the foundation of truth ! Why do you follow the streams derived from it by the sophistry , or polluted by the passions , of man ? \u2019 \u201d It may be conceived that Watson 's appeal to \u201c Scripture \u201d was against the sentence of orthodoxy . His authority as \u201c a school Divine \u201d is on a par with that of the author of Cain , or of an earlier theologian who \u201c quoted Genesis like a very learned clerk \u201d ! ]{ 209 }held that there were two co-eternal Creators \u2014 a God of Darkness who made the body , and a God of Light who was responsible for the soul \u2014 and that it was the aim and function of the good spirit to rescue the soul , the spiritual part of man , from the possession and grasp of the body , which had been created by and was in the possession of the spirit of evil . St. Augustine passed through a stage of Manicheism , and in after-life exposed and refuted the heretical tenets which he had advocated , and with which he was familiar . See , for instance , his account of the Manich\u00e6an heresy \u201c de duplici terr\u00e2 , de regno lucis et regno tenebrarum \u201d]\" Sometimes the proverb is worded thus : \u201c \u2018 Claw for claw , and the devil take the shortest nails , \u2019 as Conan said to the devil . \u201d \u2014 Waverley Novels , 1829, i . 241 , note 1 ; see , too , ibid ., p . 229 . ], Vol .

Opera-tragedy would , in his opinion , be a fitting name for it ; but he prefers interpolating the word \u2018 melo \u2019 into the middle of the word \u2018 tragedy , \u2019 so as not to spoil the ending , although by so doing he has cut in two ... the root of the word \u2014 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2\u201c \u2014 The Tragedies of Vittorio Alfieri , edited by E.

The end of the fifth act and the Drama . B. P. J ^ y 20 , 1822 . FOOTNOTES :{ 337 }, the younger of the sisters . Miss Lee began her literary career as a dramatist . A comedy , The New Peerage ; or , Our Eyes may deceive us , was played at Drury Lane , November 10 , 1787 . In 1798 she published The Mysterious Marriage ; or , The Heirship of Rosalva . After the publication of Byron 's Werner , she wrote a dramatic version of The German 's Tale , under the title of The Three Strangers . It was brought out at Covent Garden , December 10 , 1825 , and acted four times . The first volume of the Canterbury Tales , by Harriet Lee , was published in 1797 ; the second volume , by Sophia Lee , in 1798; a third volume, by Sophia and Harriet Lee , appeared in 1800 ; the fourth volume , by Harriet Leewas published in 1801 ; and the fifth volume , by Harriet Lee , in 1805 . There can be little doubt that Byron 's visit to Churchill 's grave at Dover , which took place April 25 , 1816, was suggested by a passage in the Introduction , pp . vii. - ix ., to the first volumeof the Canterbury Tales . The author \u201c wanders forth to note the memorabilia of Dover , \u201d is informed that \u201c the greatest curiosity in the place is the tomb of a poet , \u201d and hastens \u201c to a spot surrounded by ruined walls , in the midst of which stood the white marble tablet marked with Churchill 's name , \u201d etc . ]{ 338 }folly which may injure me \u2014 andno one . If it be understood that all dramatic writing is generically intended for the stage , I deny itWith the exception of Shakespeare, not one in fifty plays of our dramatists is ever acted , however much they may be read . Only one of Massinger \u2014 none of Ford \u2014 none of Marlowe , one of Ben Jonson \u2014 none of Webster , none of Heywood : and , even in Comedy , Congreve is rarely acted , and that in only one of his plays . Neither is Joanna Baillie . I am far from attempting to raise myself to a level with the least of these names \u2014 I only wish to befrom a stage which is not theirs .

FOOTNOTES :{ 473 }\u2014 \u201c Arnaud , the natural son of the Marquis de Souvricour , was a child \u2018 extraordinary in Beauty and Intellect . \u2019 When travelling with his parents to Languedoc , Arnaud being 8 years old , he was shot at by banditti , and forsaken by his parents . The Captain of the band nursed him . \u2018 But those perfections to which Arnaud owed his existence , ceased to adorn it . The ball had gored his shoulder , and the fall had dislocated it ; by the latter misadventure his spine likewise was so fatally injured as to be irrecoverable to its pristine uprightness . Injuries so compound confounded the Captain , who sorrowed to see a creature so charming , at once deformed by a crooked back and an excrescent shoulder . \u2019 Arnaud was found and taken back to his parents . \u2018 The bitterest consciousness of his deformity was derived from their indelicate , though , perhaps , insensible alteration of conduct .... Of his person he continued to speak as of an abhorrent enemy .... \u201c Were a blessing submitted to my choice , I would say ,be it my immediate dissolution . \u201d \u201c I think , \u201d said his mother , ... \u201c that you could wish better . \u201d \u201c Yes , \u201d adjoined Arnaud , \u201c for that wish should be that I ever had remained unborn . \" \u2019 He polishes the broken blade of a sword , and views himself therein ; the sight so horrifies him that he determines to throw himself over a precipice , but draws back at the last moment . He goes to a cavern , and conjures up the prince of hell . \u201c Arnaud knew himself to be interrogated . What he required .... What was that answer the effects explain .... There passed in liveliest portraiture the various men distinguished for that beauty and grace which Arnaud so much desired , that he was ambitious to purchase them with his soul . He felt that it was his part to chuse whom he would resemble , yet he remained unresolved , though the spectator of an hundred shades of renown , among which glided by Alexander , Alcibiades , and Hephestion : at length appeared the supernatural effigy of a man , whose perfections human artist never could depict or insculp \u2014 Demetrius , the son of Antigonus . Arnaud 's heart heaved quick with preference , and strait he found within his hand the resemblance of a poniard , its point inverted towards his breast . A mere automaton in the hands of the Demon , he thrust the point through his heart , and underwent a painless death . During his trance , his spirit metempsychosed from the body of his detestation to that of his admiration ... Arnaud awoke a Julian ! \u2019 \u201d ]{ 474 }, see \u201c First Visit to the Theatre in London , \u201d Poems , by Hartley Coleridge , 1851 , i ., Appendix C , pp . cxcix. - cciii . The Wood Demon in its original form was never published . ]\u201c This had long been a favourite subject with Lord Byron . I think that he mentioned it also in Switzerland . I copied it \u2014 he sending a portion of it at a time , as it was finished , to me . At this time he had a great horror of its being said that he plagiarised , or that he studied for ideas , and wrote with difficulty . Thus he gave Shelley Aikins \u2019 edition of the British poets , that it might not be found in his house by some English lounger , and reported home ; thus , too , he always dated when he began and when he ended a poem , to prove hereafter how quickly it was done . I do not think that he altered a line in this drama after he had once written it down . He composed and corrected in his mind . I do not know how he meant to finish it ; but he said himself that the whole conduct of the story was already conceived . It was at this time that a brutal paragraphalluding to his lameness appeared , which he repeated to me lest I should hear it from some one else . No action of Lord Byron 's life \u2014 scarce a line he has written \u2014 but was influenced by his personal defect . \u201dIt is possible that Mrs. Shelley alludes to a sentence in the Memoirs , etc ., of Lord Byron ., 1822 , p. 46 : \u201c A malformation of one of his feet , and other indications of a rickety constitution , served as a plea for suffering him to range the hills and to wander about at his pleasure on the seashore , that his frame might be invigorated by air and exercise . \u201d ]{ 477 } The Deformed \u2014 a drama .\u2014 B . Pisa , 1822 .quotes these lines in connection with a passage in Byron 's \u201c Memoranda , \u201d where , in speaking of his own sensitiveness on the subject of his deformed foot , he described the feeling of horror and humiliation that came over him , when his mother , in one of her fits of passion , called him \u201c a lame brat ! \u201d ... \u201c It may be questioned , \u201d he adds , \u201c whether that whole dramawas not indebted for its origin to that single recollection . \u201d Byron 's early lettersare full of complaints of his mother 's \u201c eccentric behaviour , \u201d her \u201c fits of phrenzy , \u201d her \u201c caprices , \u201d \u201c passions , \u201d and so forth ; and there is convincing proof \u2014 see Life , pp . 28 , 306 ; Letters , 1898 , ii . 122; Letters , 1901 , vi . 179\u2014 that he regarded the contraction of the muscles of his legs as a more or less repulsive deformity . And yet , to quote one of a hundred testimonies ,\u2014 \u201c with regard to Lord Byron 's features , Mr. Mathews observed , that he was the only man he ever contemplated , to whom he felt disposed to apply the word beautiful \u201dThe looker-on or the consoler computes the magnitude and the liberality of the compensation .

Not long afterwards he lost the king 's favour , who was set against him by his mother , Louise de Savoie ; was recalled from his command in Italy , and superseded by Odet de Foix , brother of the king 's mistress . It was not , however , till he became a widowerthat he finally broke with Francis and attached himself to the Emperor Charles V. Madame , the king 's mother , not only coveted the vast estates of the house of Bourbon , but was enamoured of the Constable 's person , and , so to speak , gave him his choice between marriage and a suit for his fiefs . Charles would have nothing to say to the lady 's proposals or to her son 's entreaties , and seeing that rejection meant ruin , he \u201c entered into a correspondence with the Emperor and the Kingof England ... and , finding this discovered , went into the Emperor 's service . \u201d After various and varying successes , both in the South of France and in Lombardy , he found himself , in the spring of 1527 , not so much the commander-in-chief as the popular capo of a mixed body of German , Spanish , and Italian condottieri , unpaid and ill-disciplined , who had mutinied more than once , who could only be kept together by the prospect of unlimited booty , and a timely concession to their demands . \u201c To Rome ! to Rome ! \u201d cried the hungry and tumultuous landsknechts , and on May 5 , 1527 , the \u201c late Constable of France , \u201d at the head of an army of 30 , 000 troops , appeared before the walls of the sacred city .

INTRODUCTION TO THE DEFORMED TRANSFORMED . The date of the original MS. of The Deformed Transformed is \u201c Pisa , 1822 . \u201d There is nothing to show in what month it was written , but it may be conjectured that it was begun and finished within the period which elapsed between the death of Allegra , April 20 , and the death of Shelley , July 8 , 1822 . According to Medwin, an unfavourable criticism of Shelley 's, together with a discovery that \u201c two entire lines \u201d of Southey 's \u2014 \u201c And water shall see thee , And fear thee , and flee thee \u201d \u2014 were imbedded in one of his \u201c Songs , \u201d touched Byron so deeply that he \u201c threw the poem into the fire , \u201d and concealed the existence of a second copy for more than two years . It is a fact that Byron 's correspondence does not contain the remotest allusion to The Deformed Transformed ; but , with regard to the plagiarism from Southey , in the play as written in 1822 there is neither Song nor Incantation which could have contained two lines from The Curse of Kehama . As a dramatist , Byron 's function , or m\u00e9tier , was twofold . In Manfred , in Cain , in Heaven and Earth , he is concerned with the analysis and evolution of metaphysical or ethical notions ; in Marino Faliero , in Sardanapalus , and The Two Foscari , he set himself \u201c to dramatize striking passages of history ; \u201d in The Deformed Transformed he sought to combine the solution of a metaphysical puzzle or problem , the relation of personality to individuality , with the scenic rendering of a striking historical episode , the Sack of Rome in 1527 . In the note or advertisement prefixed to the drama , Byron acknowledges that \u201c the production \u201d is founded partly on the story of a forgotten novel , The Three Brothers , and partly on \u201c the Faust of the great Goethe . \u201d Arnaud , or Julian , the hero of The Three Brothers, \u201c sells his soul to the Devil , and becomes an arch-fiend in order to avenge himself for the taunts of strangers on the deformity of his person \u201dThe idea of an escape from natural bonds or disabilities by supernatural means and at the price of the soul or will , the un-Christlike surrender to the tempter , which is the grund-stoff of the Faust-legend , was brought home to Byron , in the first instance , not by Goethe , or Calderon , or Marlowe , but by Joshua Pickersgill . A fellow-feeling lent an intimate and peculiar interest to the theme . He had suffered all his life from a painful and inconvenient defect , which his proud and sensitive spirit had magnified into a deformity . He had been stung to the quick by his mother 's taunts and his sweetheart 's ridicule , by the jeers of the base and thoughtless , by slanderous and brutal paragraphs in newspapers . He could not forget that he was lame . If his enemies had but possessed the wit , they might have given him \u201c the sobriquet of Le Diable Boiteux \u201dIt was no wonder that so poignant , so persistent a calamity should be \u201c reproduced in his poetry \u201d, or that his passionate impatience of such a \u201c thorn in the flesh \u201d should picture to itself a mysterious and unhallowed miracle of healing . It is true , as Moore says, that \u201c the trifling deformity of his foot \u201d was the embittering circumstance of his life , that it \u201c haunted him like a curse ; \u201d but it by no means follows that he seriously regarded his physical peculiarity as a stamp of the Divine reprobation , that \u201c he was possessed by an id\u00e9e fixe that every blessing would be \u2018 turned into a curse \u2019 to him \u201dNo doubt he indulged himself in morbid fancies , played with the extravagances of a restless imagination , and wedded them to verse ; but his intellect , \u201c brooding like the day , a master o'er a slave , \u201d kept guard . He would never have pleaded on his own behalf that the tyranny of an id\u00e9e fixe , a delusion that he was predestined to evil , was an excuse for his shortcomings or his sins . Byron 's very considerable obligations to The Three Brothers might have escaped notice , but the resemblance between his \u201c Stranger , \u201d or \u201c C\u00e6sar , \u201d and the Mephistopheles of \u201c the great Goethe \u201d was open and palpable . If Medwin may be trusted, Byron had read \u201c Faust in a sorry French translation , \u201d and it is probable that Shelley 's inspired rendering of \u201c May-day Night , \u201d which was published in The Liberal, had been read to him , and had attracted his attention . The Deformed Transformed is \u201c a Faustish kind of drama ; \u201d and Goethe , who maintained that Byron 's play as a whole was \u201c no imitation , \u201d but \u201c new and original , close , genuine , and spirited , \u201d could not fail to perceive that \u201c his devil was suggested by my Mephistopheles \u201dThe tempter who cannot resist the temptation of sneering at his own wiles , who mocks for mocking 's sake , is not Byron 's creation , but Goethe 's . Lucifer talked at the clergy , if he did not \u201c talk like a clergyman ; \u201d but the \u201c bitter hunchback , \u201d even when he is solus , sneers as the river wanders , \u201c at his own sweet will . \u201d He is not a doctor , but a spirit of unbelief ! The second part of The Deformed Transformed represents , in three scenes , the Siege and Sack of Rome in 1527 . Byron had read Robertson 's Charles the Fifthin his boyhood, but it is on record that he had studied , more or less closely , the narratives of contemporary authorities . A note to The Prophecy of Danterefers to the Sacco di Roma , descritto da Luigi Guicciardini , and the Ragguaglio Storico ... sacco di Roma dell \u2019 anno MDXXVII . of Jacopo Buonaparte ; and it is evident that he was familiar with Cellini 's story of the marvellous gests and exploits quorum maxima pars fuit , which were wrought at \u201c the walls by the Campo Santo , \u201d or on the ramparts of the Castle of San Angelo . The Sack of Rome was a great national calamity , and it was something more : it was a profanation and a sacrilege . The literature which it evoked was a cry of anguish , a prophetic burden of despair . \u201c Chants populaires , \u201d writes M.

PREFACE . Though it be dangerous to raise too great an expectation , especially in works of this nature , where we are to please an insatiable audience , yet it is reasonable to prepossess them in favour of an author ; and therefore , both the prologue and epilogue informed you , that OEdipus was the most celebrated piece of all antiquity ; that Sophocles , not only the greatest wit , but one of the greatest men in Athens , made it for the stage at the public cost ; and that it had the reputation of being his masterpiece , not only among the seven of his which are still remaining , but of the greater number which are perished . Aristotle has more than once admired it , in his Book of Poetry ; Horace has mentioned it : Lucullus , Julius C\u00e6sar , and other noble Romans , have written on the same subject , though their poems are wholly lost ; but Seneca 's is still preserved . In our own age , Corneille has attempted it , and , it appears by his preface , with great success . But a judicious reader will easily observe , how much the copy is inferior to the original . He tells you himself , that he owes a great part of his success , to the happy episode of Theseus and Dirce ; which is the same thing , as if we should acknowledge , that we were indebted for our good fortune to the under-plot of Adrastus , Eurydice , and Creon . The truth is , he miserably failed in the character of his hero : If he desired that OEdipus should be pitied , he should have made him a better man . He forgot , that Sophocles had taken care to show him , in his first entrance , a just , a merciful , a successful , a religious prince , and , in short , a father of his country . Instead of these , he has drawn him suspicious , designing , more anxious of keeping the Theban crown , than solicitous for the safety of his people ; hectored by Theseus , condemned by Dirce , and scarce maintaining a second part in his own tragedy . This was an error in the first concoction ; and therefore never to be mended in the second or the third . He introduced a greater hero than OEdipus himself ; for when Theseus was once there , that companion of Hercules must yield to none . The poet was obliged to furnish him with business , to make him an equipage suitable to his dignity ; and , by following him too close , to lose his other king of Brentford in the crowd . Seneca , on the other side , as if there were no such thing as nature to be minded in a play , is always running after pompous expression , pointed sentences , and philosophical notions , more proper for the study than the stage : the Frenchman followed a wrong scent ; and the Roman was absolutely at cold hunting . All we could gather out of Corneille was , that an episode must be , but not his way : and Seneca supplied us with no new hint , but only a relation which he makes of his Tiresias raising the ghost of Laius ; which is here performed in view of the audience ,\u2014 the rites and ceremonies , so far his , as he agreed with antiquity , and the religion of the Greeks . But he himself was beholden to Homer 's Tiresias , in the \u201c Odysses , \u201d for some of them ; and the rest have been collected from Heliodore 's \u201c Ethiopiques , \u201d and Lucan 's EricthoSophocles , indeed , is admirable everywhere ; and therefore we have followed him as close as possibly we could . But the Athenian theatre ,had a perfection differing from ours . You see there in every act a single scene ,which manage the business of the play ; and after that succeeds the chorus , which commonly takes up more time in singing , than there has been employed in speaking . The principal person appears almost constantly through the play ; but the inferior parts seldom above once in the whole tragedy . The conduct of our stage is much more difficult , where we are obliged never to lose any considerable character , which we have once presented . Custom likewise has obtained , that we must form an under-plot of second persons , which must be depending on the first ; and their by-walks must be like those in a labyrinth , which all of them lead into the great parterre ; or like so many several lodging chambers , which have their outlets into the same gallery . Perhaps , after all , if we could think so , the ancient method , as it is the easiest , is also the most natural , and the best . For variety , as it is managed , is too often subject to breed distraction ; and while we would please too many ways , for want of art in the conduct , we please in noneBut we have given you more already than was necessary for a preface ; and , for aught we know , may gain no more by our instructions , than that politic nation is like to do , who have taught their enemies to fight so long , that at last they are in a condition to invade themFootnotes : 1 . Heliodorus , bishop of Trica , wrote a romance in Greek , called the \u201c Ethiopiques , \u201d containing the amours of Theagenes and Chariclea . He was so fond of this production , that , the option being proposed to him by a synod , he rather chose to resign his bishopric than destroy his work . There occurs a scene of incantation in this romance . The story of Lucan 's witch occurs in the sixth book of the Pharsalia .

What Sophocles could undertake alone , Our poets found a work for more than one ; And therefore two lay tugging at the piece , With all their force , to draw the ponderous mass from Greece ; A weight that bent even Seneca 's strong muse , And which Corneille 's shoulders did refuse . So hard it is the Athenian harp to string ! So much two consuls yield to one just king . Terror and pity this whole poem sway ; The mightiest machines that can mount a play . How heavy will those vulgar souls be found , Whom two such engines cannot move from ground ! When Greece and Rome have smiled upon this birth , You can but damn for one poor spot of earth ; And when your children find your judgment such , They 'll scorn their sires , and wish themselves born Dutch ; Each haughty poet will infer with ease , How much his wit must under-write to please . As some strong churl would , brandishing , advance The monumental sword that conquered France ; So you , by judging this , your judgment teach , Thus far you like , that is , thus far you reach . Since then the vote of full two thousand years Has crowned this plot , and all the dead are theirs , Think it a debt you pay , not alms you give , And , in your own defence , let this play live .

Take the instant way ; For honour travels in a strait so narrow , Where one but goes abreast : keep then the path ; For emulation hath a thousand sons , That one by one pursue : If you give way , Or hedge aside from the direct forthright , Like to an enter 'd tide , they all rush by , And leave you hindmost .\u2014 Or , like a gallant horse fallen in first rank , Lie there for pavement to the abject rear , O'er run and trampled on : Then what they do in present , Though less than yours in past , must o'ertop yours : For time is like a fashionable host , That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand ; And with his arms out stretch 'd , as he would fly , Grasps-in the comer : Welcome ever smiles , And Farewel goes out sighing .

The present eye praises the present object : Then marvel not , thou great and complete man , That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax ; Since things in motion sooner catch the eye , Than what not stirs . The cry went once on thee , And still it might , and yet it may again , If thou would'st not entomb thyself alive , And case thy reputation in thy tent ; Whose glorious deeds , but in these fields of late , Made emulous missions \u2018 mongst the gods themselves , And drave great Mars to faction . TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE ROBERT , EARL OF SUNDERLAND, PRINCIPAL SECRETARY OF STATE , ONE OF HIS MAJESTY 'S MOST HONOURABLE PRIVY-COUNCIL , & C . MY LORD , Since I cannot promise you much of poetry in my play , it is but reasonable that I should secure you from any part of it in my dedication . And indeed I cannot better distinguish the exactness of your taste from that of other men , than by the plainness and sincerity of my address . I must keep my hyperboles in reserve for men of other understandings . An hungry appetite after praise , and a strong digestion of it , will bear the grossness of that diet ; but one of so critical a judgment as your lordship , who can set the bounds of just and proper in every subject , would give me small encouragement for so bold an undertaking . I more than suspect , my lord , that you would not do common justice to yourself ; and , therefore , were I to give that character of you , which I think you truly merit , I would make my appeal from your lordship to the reader , and would justify myself from flattery by the public voice , whatever protestation you might enter to the contrary . But I find I am to take other measures with your lordship ; I am to stand upon my guard with you , and to approach you as warily as Horace did Augustus : Cui mal\u00e8 si palpere , recalcitrat undique tutus . An ill-timed , or an extravagant commendation , would not pass upon you ; but you would keep off such a dedicator at arms-end , and send him back with his encomiums to this lord , or that lady , who stood in need of such trifling merchandise . You see , my lord , what an awe you have upon me , when I dare not offer you that incense which would be acceptable to other patrons ; but am forced to curb myself from ascribing to you those honours , which even an enemy could not deny you . Yet I must confess , I never practised that virtue of moderationwith so much reluctancy as now : for it hinders me from being true to my own knowledge , in not witnessing your worth , and deprives me of the only means which I had left , to shew the world that true honour and uninterested respect which I have always paid you . I would say somewhat , if it were possible which might distinguish that veneration I have for you , from the flatteries of those who adore your fortune . But the eminence of your condition , in this particular , is my unhappiness ; for it renders whatever I would say suspected . Professions of service , submissions , and attendance , are the practice of all men to the great ; and commonly they , who have the least sincerity , perform them best ; as they , who are least engaged in love , have their tongues the freest to counterfeit a passion . For my own part , I never could shake off the rustic bashfulness which hangs upon my nature ; but , valuing myself at as little as I am worth , have been afraid to render even the common duties of respect to those who are in power . The ceremonious visits , which are generally paid on such occasions , are not my talent . They may be real even in courtiers , but they appear with such a face of interest , that a modest man would think himself in danger of having his sincerity mistaken for his design . My congratulations keep their distance , and pass no farther than my heart . There it is that I have all the joy imaginable , when I see true worth rewarded , and virtue uppermost in the world . If , therefore , there were one to whom I had the honour to be known ; and to know him so perfectly , that I could say , without flattery , he had all the depth of understanding that was requisite in an able statesman , and all that honesty which commonly is wanting ; that he was brave without vanity , and knowing without positiveness ; that he was loyal to his prince , and a lover of his country ; that his principles were full of moderation , and all his counsels such as tended to heal , and not to widen , the breaches of the nation : that in all his conversation there appeared a native candour , and a desire of doing good in all his actions : if such an one , whom I have described , were at the helm ; if he had risen by his merits , and were chosen out in the necessity and pressures of affairs , to remedy our confusions by the seasonableness of his advice , and to put a stop to our ruin , when we were just rolling downward to the precipice ; I should then congratulate the age in which I live , for the common safety ; I should not despair of the republic , though Hannibal were at the gates ; I should send up my vows for the success of such an action , as Virgil did , on the like occasion , for his patron , when he was raising up his country from the desolations of a civil war : Hunc saltem everso juvenem succurrere seclo Ne , superi , prohibete . I know not whither I am running , in this extacy which is now upon me : I am almost ready to re-assume the ancient rights of poetry ; to point out , and prophecy the man , who was born for no less an undertaking , and whom posterity shall bless for its accomplishment . Methinks , I am already taking fire from such a character , and making room for him , under a borrowed name , amongst the heroes of an epic poem . Neither could mine , or some more happy genius , want encouragement under such a patron : Pollio amat nostram , quamvis sit rustica , musam . But these are considerations afar off , my lord : the former part of the prophecy must be first accomplished ; the quiet of the nation must be secured ; and a mutual trust , betwixt prince and people , be renewed ; and then this great and good man will have leisure for the ornaments of peace ; and make our language as much indebted to his care , as the French is to the memory of their famous RichelieuYou know , my lord , how low he laid the foundations of so great a work ; that he began it with a grammar and a dictionary ; without which all those remarks and observations , which have since been made , had been performed to as little purpose , as it would be to consider the furniture of the rooms , before the contrivance of the house . Propriety must first be stated , ere any measures of elegance can be taken . Neither is one Vaugelas sufficient for such a workIt was the employment of the whole academy for many years ; for the perfect knowledge of a tongue was never attained by any single person . The court , the college , and the town , must be joined in it . And as our English is a composition of the dead and living tongues , there is required a perfect knowledge , not only of the Greek and Latin , but of the old German , the French , and the Italian ; and , to help all these , a conversation with those authors of our own , who have written with the fewest faults in prose and verse . But how barbarously we yet write and speak , your lordship knows , and I am sufficiently sensible in my own English . For I am often put to a stand , in considering whether what I write be the idiom of the tongue , or false grammar , and nonsense couched beneath that specious name of Anglicism ; and have no other way to clear my doubts , but by translating my English into Latin , and thereby trying what sense the words will bear in a more stable language . I am desirous , if it were possible , that we might all write with the same certainty of words , and purity of phrase , to which the Italians first arrived , and after them the French ; at least that we might advance so far , as our tongue is capable of such a standard . It would mortify an Englishman to consider , that from the time of Boccace and of Petrarch , the Italian has varied very little ; and that the English of Chaucer , their contemporary , is not to be understood without the help of an old dictionary . But their Goth and Vandal had the fortune to be grafted on a Roman stock ; ours has the disadvantage to be founded on the DutchWe are full of monosyllables , and those clogged with consonants , and our pronunciation is effeminate ; all which are enemies to a sounding language . It is true , that to supply our poverty , we have trafficked with our neighbour nations ; by which means we abound as much in words , as Amsterdam does in religions ; but to order them , and make them useful after their admission , is the difficulty . A greater progress has been made in this , since his majesty 's return , than , perhaps , since the conquest to his time . But the better part of the work remains unfinished ; and that which has been done already , since it has only been in the practice of some few writers , must be digested into rules and method , before it can be profitable to the general . Will your lordship give me leave to speak out at last ? and to acquaint the world , that from your encouragement and patronage , we may one day expect to speak and write a language , worthy of the English wit , and which foreigners may not disdain to learn ? Your birth , your education , your natural endowments , the former employments which you have had abroad , and that which , to the joy of good men you now exercise at home , seem all to conspire to this design : the genius of the nation seems to call you out as it were by name , to polish and adorn your native language , and to take from it the reproach of its barbarity . It is upon this encouragement that I have adventured on the following critique , which I humbly present you , together with the play ; in which , though I have not had the leisure , nor indeed the encouragement , to proceed to the principal subject of it , which is the words and thoughts that are suitable to tragedy ; yet the whole discourse has a tendency that way , and is preliminary to it . In what I have already done , I doubt not but I have contradicted some of my former opinions , in my loose essays of the like nature ; but of this , I dare affirm , that it is the fruit of my riper age and experience , and that self-love , or envy have no part in it . The application to English authors is my own , and therein , perhaps , I may have erred unknowingly ; but the foundation of the rules is reason , and the authority of those living critics who have had the honour to be known to you abroad , as well as of the ancients , who are not less of your acquaintance . Whatsoever it be , I submit it to your lordship 's judgment , from which I never will appeal , unless it be to your good nature , and your candour . If you can allow an hour of leisure to the perusal of it , I shall be fortunate that I could so long entertain you ; if not , I shall at least have the satisfaction to know , that your time was more usefully employed upon the public . I am , MY LORD , Your Lordship 's most Obedient , Humble Servant , JOHN DRYDEN . Footnotes : 1 .

These cruel critics put me into passion ; For , in their lowering looks I read damnation : You expect a satire , and I seldom fail ; When I 'm first beaten , \u2018 tis my part to rail . You British fools , of the old Trojan stock , That stand so thick , one cannot miss the flock , Poets have cause to dread a keeping pit , When women 's cullies come to judge of wit . As we strew rat'shYpppHeNbane when we vermin fear , \u2018 Twere worth our cost to scatter fool-bane here ; And , after all our judging fops were served , Dull poets , too , should have a dose reserved ; Such reprobates , as , past all sense of shaming , Write on , and ne'er are satisfied with damning : Next , those , to whom the stage does not belong , Such whose vocation only is \u2014 to song ; At most to prologue , when , for want of time , Poets take in for journey-work in rhime . But I want curses for those mighty shoals Of scribbling Chloris 's , and Phyllis \u2019 fools : Those oafs should be restrained , during their lives , From pen and ink , as madmen are from knives . I could rail on , but \u2018 twere a task as vain , As preaching truth at Rome , or wit in Spain : Yet , to huff out our play was worth my trying ; John Lilburn \u2018 scaped his judges by defying :If guilty , yet I 'm sure o \u2019 the church 's blessing , By suffering for the plot , without confessing . Footnote : 1 . Lilburn , the most turbulent , but the boldest and most upright of men , had the merit of defying and resisting the tyranny of the king , of the parliament , and of the protector . He was convicted in the star-chamber , but liberated by the parliament ; he was tried on the parliamentary statute for treasons in 1651 , and before Cromwell 's high court of justice in 1654 ; and notwithstanding an audacious defence ,\u2014 which to some has been more perilous than a feeble cause ,\u2014 he was , in both cases , triumphantly acquitted . THE SPANISH FRIAR ; OR , THE DOUBLE DISCOVERY . Ut melius possis fallere , sume togam . \u2014 MART . \u2014 Alterna revisens Lasit , et in solido rursus fortuna locavit . \u2014 VIRG . THE SPANISH FRIAR . The Spanish Friar , or the Double Discovery , is one of the best and most popular of our poet 's dramatic efforts . The plot is , as Johnson remarks , particularly happy , for the coincidence and coalition of the tragic and comic plots . The grounds for this eminent critic 's encomium will be found to lie more deep than appears at first sight . It was , indeed , a sufficiently obvious connection , to make the gay Lorenzo an officer of the conquering army , and attached to the person of Torrismond . This expedient could hardly have escaped the invention of the most vulgar playwright , that ever dovetailed tragedy and comedy together . The felicity of Dryden 's plot , therefore , does not consist in the ingenuity of his original conception , but in the minutely artificial strokes , by which the reader is perpetually reminded of the dependence of the one part of the play on the other . These are so frequent , and appear so very natural , that the comic plot , instead of diverting our attention from the tragic business , recals it to our mind by constant and unaffected allusion . No great event happens in the higher region of the camp or court , that has not some indirect influence upon the intrigues of Lorenzo and Elvira ; and the part which the gallant is called upon to act in the revolution that winds up the tragic interest , while it is highly in character , serves to bring the catastrophe of both parts of the play under the eye of the spectator , at one and the same time . Thus much seemed necessary to explain the felicity of combination , upon which Dryden justly valued himself , and which Johnson sanctioned by his high commendation . But , although artfully conjoined , the different departments of this tragi-comedy are separate subjects of critical remark . The comic part of the Spanish Friar , as it gives the first title to the play , seems to claim our first attention . Indeed , some precedence is due to it in another point of view ; for , though the tragic scenes may be matched in All for Love , Don Sebastian , and else where , the Spanish Friar contains by far the most happy of Dryden 's comic effusions . It has , comparatively speaking , this high claim to commendation , that , although the intrigue is licentious , according to the invariable licence of the age , the language is , in general , free from the extreme and disgusting coarseness , which our author too frequently mistook for wit , or was contented to substitute in its stead . The liveliness and even brilliancy of the dialogue , shows that Dryden , from the stores of his imagination , could , when he pleased , command that essential requisite of comedy ; and that , if he has seldom succeeded , it was only because he mistook the road , or felt difficulty in travelling it . The character of Dominic is of that broadly ludicrous nature , which was proper to the old comedy . It would be difficult to show an ordinary conception more fully brought out . He is , like Falstaff , a compound of sensuality and talent , finely varied by the professional traits with which it suited the author 's purpose to adorn his character . Such an addition was , it is true , more comic than liberal ; but Dryden , whose constant dislike to the clerical order glances out in many of his performances , was not likely to be scrupulous , when called upon to pourtray one of their members in his very worst colours . To counterbalance the Friar 's scandalous propensities of every sort , and to render him an object of laughter , rather than abhorrence , the author has gifted this reprobate churchman with a large portion of wit ; by means of which , and by a ready presence of mind , always indicative of energy , he preserves an ascendence over the other characters , and escapes detection and disgrace , until poetical justice , and the conclusion of the play , called for his punishment . We have a natural indulgence for an amusing libertine ; and , I believe , that , as most readers commiserate the disgrace of Falstaff , a few may be found to wish that Dominic 's penance had been of a nature more decent and more theatrical than the poet has assigned himFrom the dedication , as well as the prologue , it appears that Dryden , however contrary to his sentiments at a future period , was , at present , among those who held up to contempt and execration the character of the Roman catholic priesthood . By one anonymous lampoon , this is ascribed to a temporary desertion of the court party , in resentment for the loss , or discontinuance of his pension . This allowance , during the pressure upon the Exchequer , was , at least , irregularly paid , of which Dryden repeatedly complains , and particularly in a letter to the Earl of Rochester . But the hardship was owing entirely to the poverty of the public purse ; and , when the anonymous libeller affirms , that Dryden 's pension was withdrawn , on account of his share in the Essay on Satire , he only shows that his veracity is on a level with his povertyThe truth seems to be , that Dryden partook in some degree of the general ferment which the discovery of the Popish Plot had excited ; and we may easily suppose him to have done so without any impeachment to his monarchial tenets , since North himself admits , that at the first opening of the plot , the chiefs of the loyal party joined in the cry . Indeed , that mysterious transaction had been investigated by none more warmly than by Danby , the king 's favourite minister , and a high favourer of the prerogative . Even when writing Absalom and Achitophel , our author by no means avows an absolute disbelief of the whole plot , while condemning the extraordinary exaggerations , by which it had been rendered the means of much bloodshed and persecutionIt seems , therefore , fair to believe , that , without either betraying or disguising his own principles , he chose , as a popular subject for the drama , an attack upon an obnoxious priesthood , whom he , in common with all the nation , believed to have been engaged in the darkest intrigues against the king and government . I am afraid that this task was the more pleasing , from that prejudice against the clergy , of all countries and religions , which , as already noticed , our author displays , in common with other wits of that licentious ageThe character of the Spanish Friar was not , however , forgotten , when Dryden became a convert to the Roman Catholic persuasion ; and , in many instances , as well as in that just quoted , it was assumed as the means of fixing upon him a charge of inconsistency in politics , and versatility in religionThe tragic part of the \u201c Spanish Friar \u201d has uncommon merit . The opening of the Drama , and the picture of a besieged town in the last extremity , is deeply impressive , while the description of the noise of the night attack , and the gradual manner in which the intelligence of its success is communicated , arrests the attention , and prepares expectation for the appearance of the hero , with all the splendour which ought to attend the principal character in tragedy . The subsequent progress of the plot is liable to a capital objection , from the facility with which the queen , amiable and virtuous , as we are bound to suppose her , consents to the murder of the old dethroned monarch . We question if the operation of any motive , however powerful , could have been pleaded with propriety , in apology for a breach of theatrical decorum , so gross , and so unnatural . But , in fact , the queen is only actuated by a sort of reflected ambition , a desire to secure to her lover a crown , which she thought in danger ; but which , according to her own statement , she only valued on his account . This is surely too remote and indirect a motive , to urge a female to so horrid a crime . There is also something vilely cold-hearted , in her attempt to turn the guilt and consequences of her own crime upon Bertran , who , whatever faults he might have to others , was to the queen no otherwise obnoxious , than because the victim of her own inconstancy . The gallant , virtuous , and enthusiastic character of Torrismond , must be allowed , in some measure , to counterbalance that of his mistress , however unhappily he has placed his affections . But the real excellence of these scenes consists less in peculiarity of character , than in the vivacity and power of the language , which , seldom sinking into vulgarity , or rising into bombast , maintains the mixture of force and dignity , best adapted to the expression of tragic passion . Upon the whole , as the comic part of this play is our author 's master-piece in comedy , the tragic plot may be ranked with his very best efforts of that kind , whether in \u201c Don Sebastian , \u201d or \u201c All for Love . \u201d The \u201c Spanish Friar \u201d appears to have been brought out shortly after Mr Thynne 's murder , which is alluded to in the Prologue , probably early in 1681-2 . The whimsical caricature , which it presented to the public , in Father Dominic , was received with rapture by the prejudiced spectators , who thought nothing could be exaggerated in the character of a Roman Catholic priest . Yet , the satire was still more severe in the first edition , and afterwards considerably softenedIt was , as Dryden himself calls it , a Protestant play ; and certainly , as Jeremy Collier somewhere says , was rare Protestant diversion , and much for the credit of the Reformation . Accordingly , the \u201c Spanish Friar \u201d was the only play prohibited by James II . after his accession ; an interdict , which may be easily believed no way disagreeable to the author , now a convert to the Roman church . It is very remarkable , that , after the Revolution , it was the first play represented by order of queen Mary , and honoured with her presence ; a choice , of which she had abundant reason to repent , as the serious part of the piece gave as much scope for malicious application against herself , as the comic against the religion of her fatherFootnotes : 1 . Collier remarks the injustice of punishing the agent of Lorenzo 's vice , while he was himself brought off with flying colours . He observes , \u201c \u2018 Tis not the fault which is corrected , but the priest . The author 's discipline is seldom without a bias . He commonly gives the laity the pleasure of an ill action , and the clergy the punishment . \u201d View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the Stage , p. 100 .", "Hates all he sees , and rails at all he knows ;", "For both our honour and our shame in this", "Must imitate our aukward motions first ;", "Bellowing his passion till he break the spring ,", "Nestor shall do't ; but , pardon , father Nestor ,\u2014"]}, "act_index": 29, "play_index": 29}, {"data": {"1158": ["Go , Diomede , and stand by valiant Ajax ; As you and lord \u00c6neas shall consent , So let the fight proceed , or terminate .", "\u00c6n .", "Has with long difficulties been involved ,", "And under-honest .
