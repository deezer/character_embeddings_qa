You think too much of young men . \u201d", "Campbell , admiring him across the table : \u201c Oh , Willis , how perfectly delightful you are ! \u201d", "Campbell : \u201c You wo n't go and tease that poor boy about his letter , will you ? Just hand it to him , and say you suppose here is something that has come into your possession by mistake , and that you wish to restore it to him , and then \u2014 just run off . \u201d", "Campbell : \u201c How could you tell which were the ladies \u2019 ? Come , now , Willis , do n't tease me any longer . You know I hate it . \u201d Campbell , studying the superscriptions , one after another : \u201c I want to see if I can guess who wrote them . Do n't you like to guess who wrote your letters before you open them ? \u201d", "Campbell : \u201c But how can you ? Remember how sensitive , how shrinking he is . Do n't , Willis ; you must n't . It will kill him ! \u201d", "Campbell : \u201c Do n't try to stop him ; he 's fiendish when he begins teasing . \u201d", "Campbell : \u201c I am very sorry , but I can n't help it . I must go . \u201d Campbell continues to prevent her flight , and she suddenly whirls about and makes a dash at the open window . \u201c Oh , very well , then ! I can get out this way . \u201d At the same moment Miss Rice and Miss Greenway appear before the window on the piazza . \u201c Ugh ! E \u2014 e \u2014 e ! How you frightened me ! But \u2014 but come in . So gl \u2014 glad to see you ! And you \u2014 you too , Miss Greenway . Here 's Mr. Welling . He 's been desolating us with a story about having to be away over my party , and just getting back for Mrs. Curwen 's . Is n't it too bad ? Ca n't some of you young ladies \u2014 or all of you \u2014 make him stay ? \u201d As Mrs. Campbell talks on , she readjusts her spirit more and more to the exigency , and subdues her agitation to a surface of the sweetest politeness . VIII MISS RICE , MISS GREENWAY , and the OTHERS Miss Rice , entering with an unopened letter in her hand , which she extends to Mrs. Campbell : \u201c What in the world does it all mean , Mrs. Campbell , your sending your letters flying after me at this rate ? \u201d", "Campbell : \u201c Well , I 'll give you some coffee ; but do n't you touch a single one of those letters \u2014 after what you 've said . \u201d", "Campbell , in her handkerchief : \u201c Oh , I do n't know ; I do n't know why he should address such language to me ! \u201d Campbell , recurring to the letter : \u201c I never did . \u2018 Oh , my darling \u2014 live till I see you \u2014 ends of the earth \u2014 others will be nothing \u2014 beautiful thoughtfulness \u2014 mine , mine , mine \u2014 our love \u2014 sweet to think no one suspects it \u2014 forever yours . \u2019 Amy , these are pretty strong expressions to use towards the wife of another , and she a married lady ! I think I had better go and solve that little problem of how he can live till he sees you by relieving him of the necessity . It would be disagreeable to him , but perhaps there 's a social duty involved . \u201d", "Campbell : \u201c I should have thought you 'd insist on my opening it , after that . \u201d", "Campbell , clutching the letter from him , and scanning it in a daze : \u201c What ! Oh , my goodness ! It is ! I have ! Oh , I shall die ! Run ! Call her back ! Shriek , Willis ! \u201d They rush to the window together . \u201c No , no ! It 's too late ! She 's given it to their man , and now nothing can save me ! Oh , Willis ! Willis ! Willis ! This is all your fault , with that fatal suggestion of yours . Oh , if you had only left it to me I never should have got into such a scrape ! She will think now that I 've been trying to hoax her , and she 's perfectly implacable at the least hint of a liberty , and she 'll be ready to kill me . I do n't know what she wo n't do . Oh , Willis , how could you get me into this ! \u201d Campbell , irately : \u201c Get you into this ! Now , Amy , this is a little too much . You got yourself into it . You urged me to think of something \u2014 \u201d", "Campbell : \u201c A shame ? How can you provide if you do n't know how many are coming ? I should like to know that .

FOOTNOTES :This speech is not appropriated in the original , although divided from the wife 's : neither are the words between brackets altogether an insertion of my own .

Thy soule on prisoners prayers shall mount to heaven : The Plummers and the Workemen have survey 'd the ground From Paddington ; from whence I'l have laid pipes Long to London to convey sweet water into Ludgate ; From fresh Springs : when charity tunes the pipe , the Poore man sings . Enter Keeper . How now , Keeper . As I had occasion to give a note here , I thought one sample of the original might gratify the reader 's curiosity , and he has a miniature of the whole work . The poet , who is here very minute in the description of Stephen 's charity , is justified by the inscription on the wall quoted by Stow . On this subject , however , Strype observes , \u201c The water I find not to be altogether his gift ; for that I perused lately a book , wherein I found a memorandum , that Sir Robert Knowlesgave maintenance for the supply of the prisoners of Ludgate and Newgate for ever \u201dThere can be little doubt , however , that this excellent man did something for the benefit of the prisoners , in regard to the supplying them with water .\u2014 Dilke .I suspect Arundel to have been of Cranmer 's school , and to have prophesied of what had actually happened . The following extract from a pamphlet of that time called , \u201c Thieves falling out , true Men come by their Goods , \u201djustifies the supposition : \u201c And Shoreditch will complain to Dame Ann a Clear , if we of the sisterhood , should not uphold her jollity . \u201d It is not through the inattention of the editor that this , and the preceding speech of Brewen 's , halt so lamentably ; he has , in fact , exercised his utmost skill ; but , as with many other passages in this drama , his success has not equalled his exertion .This lady proved a false prophetess .The 4o reads , \u201c What shall I say , except my hand and heart ; \u201d and Stephen may mean , What shall I offer except , & c .; but it seems a forced construction .

INTRODUCTION William Cartwright was , according to Lloyd ,born the 16th of August 1615 , though Woodsays he was born at Northway , near Tewksbury , Gloucestershire , in September 1611 , and christened on the 26th of the same month . There is as much difference between these two writers , with respect to his father , as there is concerning the time of his birth . Lloyd says he was the son of Thomas Cartwright of Burford , in Oxfordshire . Wood asserts that his father 's name was William Cartwright , one who had dissipated a fair inheritance , and was at last reduced to keep an inn at Cirencester . These contradictory accounts are totally irreconcilable . Wood 's , however , is probably the true one .That author says that Cartwright received part of his education under Mr William Top , master of the Free School at Cirencester ; was from thence sent to Westminster , where he completed his education under Mr Lambert Osbaldiston ; and in the year 1628was chosen a student of Christ Church in Oxford , and placed under the care of Mr Terrent . He took his several degrees of Bachelor and Master of Arts \u2014 the latter in 1635 ; and afterwards entering into holy orders , became , as Woodexpresses it , \u201c the most florid and seraphical preacher in the University . \u201d In October 1642 , Bishop Duppa conferred on him the place of Succentor in the Church of Salisbury ; and on the 12th of April 1643 , he was admitted junior proctor of the University . He died the 29th of November following of a malignant fever , universally lamented by every person who knew him , even by his sovereign , who showed him particular marks of his respect .He was buried at the upper end of the south aisle , adjoining to the choir of the cathedral of Christ Church . \u201c He was , \u201d says Langbaine , \u201c extremely remarkable both for his outward and inward endowments , his body being as handsome as his soul . He was an expert linguist , understanding not only Greek and Latin , but French and Italian , as perfectly as his mother tongue . He was an excellent orator , and yet an admirable poet , a quality which Cicero , with all his pains , could not attain to . Nor was Aristotle less known to him than Cicero and Virgil ; and those who heard his metaphysical lectures gave him the preference to all his predecessors , the present Bishop of Lincolnexcepted . His sermons were as much admired as his other composures ; and one fitly applied to our author that saying of Aristotle concerning AEschrion the poet , that he could not tell what AEschrion could not do . \u201d Ben Jonson said of him with some passion , My son Cartwright writes all like a man ; and Dr Fell , Bishop of Oxford , gave him this character : Cartwright was the utmost man could come to . Besides a sermon and some Greek and Latin poems , he was the author of four plays , one only of which , I believe , was published in his lifetime , viz .\u2014", "As is proposed .", "That we know of you , sir , the cause", "You fall betwixt two pillars , sir ; is't not so ?", "The theatre of kings to look upon .", "Most high and sovereign : we return all thanks", "You may boast it largely ; \u2018 tis a subject 's happiness", "Make known to all distressed travellers ,", "Let now our heralds in the streets proclaim", "Unto our loving citizens ;", "Above a queen 's .

The emigrations , on these accounts , at length became so general , that a proclamation was put forth in 1635 to stop those who had determined to follow their friends . It is remarkable that amongst those who were actually on shipboard , and prevented by the proclamation from proceeding on their voyage , were the patriot Hampden and his cousin Oliver Cromwell .

The second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood ; which before , cold and settled , left the liver white and pale , which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice ; but the sherris warms it , and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extremes . It illumineth the face , which , as a beacon , gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom , man , to arm ; and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain , the heart , who , great and puff 'd up with this retinue , doth any deed of courage \u2014 and this valour comes of sherris . So that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack , for that sets it a-work ; and learning , a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till sack commences it and sets it in act and use . Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant ; for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father , he hath , like lean , sterile , and bare land , manured , husbanded , and till 'd , with excellent endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris , that he is become very hot and valiant .

If I had fared abroad I should have found In many countries many marvels for you Though not more comeliness in peopled Romeborg And not more haughtiness in Mickligarth Nor craftiness in all the isles of the world , And only golden coifs in Athcliath : Yet you were ardent that I should not sail , And when I could not sail you laughed out loud And kissed me home ....", ", parrying the blows with the bill .

His wife wondering how he came by so much money , was afraid he gott it not honestlye ; at last he told her , and afterwards he never found any more . \u201d There are numerous literary allusions to this superstition : e. g ., Shakespeare , The Winter 's Tale , III , iii , 127 , ff . : \u201c This is fairy gold , boy ; and \u2018 twill prove so .

Overbury says of the Inns of Court Man , in his Characters : \u201c Hee is distinguished from a scholler by a pair of silk-stockings , and a beaver hat , which make him contemn a scholler as much as a scholler doth a school-master .... He is as far behind a courtier in his fashion , as a scholler is behind him .... He laughs at every man whose band sits not well , or that hath not a faire shoo-tie , and he is ashamed to be seen in any mans company that weares not his clothes well .

These customes were generall to the Scythians of Europe and Asia\" V , ii , 40. made no hornes at me \u2014 to \u201c make horns \u201d at any one was the common method of taunting one with having horns ,\u2014 i. e ., with being a cuckold .

C ., and consented to withdraw after receiving a large ransom of gold ;\u2014 andBrennus , who led the irruption of the Gauls into Greece in the second century B. C ., and attempted to despoil Delphi of its treasure , but did not succeed in doing so . The fact that their respective expeditions are said to have borne an immediate sequel of disaster and death for both alike , may be responsible for the dramatist 's mistake .

An alternative possibility should be noted , however : that presumptions by mis-reading from the Ms .may be a mis-print for presumptious= presumptive , in which case more would be retained , with the passage to mean : \u201c You must find other proofs to strengthen these , and they must , moreover , be of a nature to give more reasonable grounds for presumption . \u201d V , iii , 174-5 .\u2014 The last two lines of Charalois \u2019 speech are addressed to his judges ; what preceded them to Novall . V , iii , 190. bands \u2014 the emendation bawds , proposed by Coxeter and followed by all subsequent editors , seems almost surely correct . \u201c Bawd \u201d prior to 1700 was a term applied to men as well as \u2014 and , indeed , more frequently than \u2014 to women .

CULCHARD is sitting by one of the pillars , engaged in constructing a sonnet .

I do n't even know whether she 's going or not \u2014 for certain .", "Quite a mistake on your part , I assure you , my dear fellow . I am sure she will learn to appreciate you \u2014 er \u2014 fully when you meet again , which , I may tell you , will be at no very distant date . I happen to know that she will be at the Italian Lakes next month , and so shall we , if you let me manage this tour my own way .", "My dear Podbury , this is really too childish ! There 's no sense in travelling together , if we 're going to stay at different hotels !", "And give up Nuremberg ? Thank you !", "Podbury knows very little about women . If Hyp \u2014 Miss Prendergast \u2014 once found out why I renounced my suitorship , I should have very little peace , I know that \u2014 I 've taken particular care not to betray my attachment to Maud . I 'm afraid she 's beginning to notice it , but I must be careful . I do n't like this sudden intimacy between them \u2014 it makes things so very awkward .

I really must go up and put a stop to it , presently .UNDER THE TREE .", "I am not aware that I wanted to get out of it . I merely proposed in your \u2014\u2014What are you cackling at now ?", "You may invoke every female relative you possess in the world , but it wo n't alter the fact , and that alone ought to convince you \u2014\u2014", "Doubtless . But I am hindering your sketch ?", "No , I think not , thanks . I 'm very comfortable where I am .", "I 've bungled it ! I might have known I should only make matters worse ! On the Piazzetta ; it is moonlight , the Campanile and dome of San Giorgio Maggiore are silhouetted sharp and black against the steel-blue sky across a sea of silver ripples . PODBURY and CULCHARD are pacing slowly arm-in-arm between the two columns .", "Grieving ! Ah , if I could only tell you what I went through !But all that is past . And now may I not expect a more definite answer to the question I asked at Bingen ? Your reply then was \u2014 well , a little ambiguous .", "When you have extracted sufficient entertainment from that very small joke , you will perhaps allow Miss Prendergast to sit down and begin her sketch . You may not be aware that you 've taken her place .", "There are one or two mountains , I believe . But , personally , I should prefer Italy .", "Cut up ? Why should I be cut up , my dear fellow ?\u2014 about what ?", "Pshaw ! The button is a trifle too \u2014Good Heavens , it \u2014 it 's gone !", "No , the Modern Spirit is too earnestly intent upon solving the problems of existence to tolerate humour in its literature . Humour has served a certain purpose in its day , but that day is done , and I for one cannot pretend to regret its decay .", "Miss Trotter ! You ! What an egoist you are , my dear fellow ! I was referring to myself and Miss Prendergast . And you can n't deny that , both at Nuremberg and Constance , she \u2014\u2014", "Brutal selfishness !Now if I can only get off to sleep while that little beast is quiet \u2014\u2014 MOSQUITOPing-a-wing-wing ! Same Scene ; the next morning .", "Well , about myself \u2014 naturally .", "She has refused you ? My dear Podbury , I 'm really delighted to hear this \u2014 at least , that is \u2014\u2014", "Evidently . I suppose there 's no chance of a \u2014 a reconciliation up there ?", "Er \u2014 no . The fact is , I 've just heard from my Chief \u2014 a \u2014 a most intemperate communication , insisting on my instant return to my duties ! I shall have to humour him , I suppose , and leave at once .", "BOB", "Was I amused ?", "Well , we might spend the morning in St. Mark 's \u2014\u2014?", "Glorious view one gets at each fresh turn of the road , Podbury ! Look at Hinter-rhein , far down below there , like a toy village , and that vast desolate valley , with the grey river rushing through it , and the green glacier at the end , and these awful snow-covered peaks all round \u2014 look , man !", "I am willing to make allowance for your state of mind , Podbury , but such an expression as \u2014 as jabber , applied to my \u2014 er \u2014 well-meant attempts at consolation , and just as I was about to propose an arrangement \u2014 really , it 's too much ! The moment we reach the hotel , I will relieve you from any further infliction fromwhat you are pleased to call my \u201c jabber \u201d !", "Oh , let me see \u2014 just arriving at St. Moritz , I expect . Wonderful effect of colour , that is .", "Perfectly , thanks . My mind is being \u2014 er \u2014 stimulated here in the direction most congenial to it .", "Culchard feels slightly Uncomfortable .", "Ah , Podbury , take the good the gods provide you and be content ! You might be worse off , believe me !", "That 's childishness , my dear fellow ; you ought to talk about it \u2014 it will do you good . And really , I 'm not at all sure , after all , that we have not both of us had a fortunate escape . One is very apt to \u2014 er \u2014 overrate the fascinations of persons one meets abroad . Now neither of those two was quite \u2014\u2014", "I \u2014 er \u2014 really see no necessity . He 's done nothing whatever to deserve it !", "I 'm \u2014 er \u2014 tremendously obliged . I really can n't say how .\u2014But you need not have taken advantage of it to try to do me out of going to Nuremberg \u2014 it was a shabby trick !", "Only in words ; that is , I record my impressions in a poetic form . A perfect sonnet may render a scene , a mood , a passing thought , more indelibly than the most finished sketch ; may it not ?", "I \u2014 ah \u2014 appear to have interrupted a highly interesting conversation ?", "Eagle again ! Now mind , Podbury , no going back after this . It must be Nuremberg now .", "Is n't it a little late in the day to be cultivating an eye for colour ? I was about to say that those two girls have treated us infamously . I say deliberately , my dear Podbury , infamously !", "Hardly , my dear fellow \u2014 they 're pictures , as it happens .", "A most excellent method of obtaining it , no doubt .Numero vingt-sept , demi bouteille de Chianti , et siphon !", "That 's all I am to her . A beast of burden ! And a whole precious morning squandered on this confounded shopping \u2014 when I might have been \u2014 ah , well ! On the Grand Canal . 9 P. M. A brilliant moonlight night ; a music-barge , hung with coloured lanterns , is moving slowly up towards the Rialto , surrounded and followed by a fleet of gondolas , amongst which is one containing the TROTTERS and CULCHARD . CULCHARD has just discovered \u2014 with an embarrassment not wholly devoid of a certain excitement \u2014 that they are drawing up to a gondola occupied by the PRENDERGASTS and PODBURY .", "As you choose . I gave you the opportunity \u2014 out of kindness . If you prefer to make yourself ridiculous by hanging about here , it 's no concern of mine . I dare say I shall enjoy Florence at least as well by myself .", "Take my advice , and do n't press me , my dear fellow ; you may regret it if you do !", "My little affair ? Get over ?Oh , ah , to be sure . Yes , thank you , my dear fellow , it is not making me particularly unhappy .", "Er \u2014 Podbury , it has occurred } to me that we might \u2014\u2014} } leave this place to-morrow ! PODB .

So good-night \u2014 or , rather \u2014 er \u2014 good-bye .", "Now , look here , Podbury . I 'm not in the mood for any more of your foolery \u2014\u2014", "You do n't appear to be exactly heartbroken ?", "Well , do you withdraw jabber ?", "What a surly boor it is ! But I do n't care \u2014 I 'll do him a good turn , in spite of himself !Do you know , I 've just been having a chat with poor young Prendergast . He seems quite cut up at being forced to side with his sister . I undertook to \u2014 er \u2014 intercede for him . Now is it quite fair , or like your \u2014 er \u2014 usual good-nature , to visit his sister 's offences \u2014 whatever they are \u2014 on him ? I \u2014 I only put it to you .", "You do n't say so ! Then all I can say , Podbury , is that if we two can n't manage , in a place like this , to recover all the ground we have lost \u2014\u2014", "I should have thought myself that mere personality is hardly enough to give point to any repartee \u2014 there is a slight difference between brilliancy and \u2014 er \u2014 brutality !", "Why should I \u201c tit up , \u201d as you call it , when I 've already made up my mind to go ?

I do n't see why she should mention Van Boodeler now !", "It \u2014 it 's going down . Nothing to what it was , half an hour ago !", "I am very glad to hear you say so . I was rather afraid you had taken a dislike \u2014 er \u2014 in that quarter .", "Not yet . Good-night .You tasteless dolt !", "I am obliging Miss Prendergast , and her only .Would you prefer me to face you , Miss Prendergast ?", "You find these old churches rather oppressive , I dare say .

Then I could easily \u2014\u2014", "Just as likely she had had enough of your buffoonery !", "It 's the best place to get to Cologne and up the Rhine from .

But that 's Italian all over \u2014 hem \u2014 as Podbury would say ! Wonder , by the way , if he expected to be asked to come with me . I 've no reason for sacrificing myself like that any longer !Ah , Hypatia , if you could know what a dreary disenchanted blank you have made of my life ! And I who believed you capable of appreciating such devotion as mine !", "In spite of my tendency to \u201c jaw \u201d and \u201c jabber \u201d ?", "I really do n't see any necessity \u2014 however ,\u2014", "I 'm exceedingly obliged \u2014 but so large a party is scarcely \u2014 however , I 'll let you know whether I can join you or not this evening .

Poor fellow , he is not without his good points ; but I do find him a thorn in my flesh occasionally , I 'm afraid .", "I suppose I shall have to stay here now . You 're not going ?", "I put that to her , and there is nothing in it . In fact , she practically admitted \u2014I will tell you another time . That lady over there is looking at us , and I 'm almost certain \u2014\u2014", "Afraid she 's gone too far \u2014 thinks she 'll smooth me down ! Upon my word , it would serve her right to \u2014 but no , I wo n't be petty .Pray tell Miss Prendergast that I have no immediate intention of altering my position .", "You entirely misunderstood me . There was no definite understanding between us \u2014 nothing of the sort or kind . In fact , it was merely a passing caprice .

I loathe and detest a prig , but a flirt I despise \u2014 yes , despise , Podbury !", "Thank you . I trust it will \u2014 er \u2014 have that effect .Now , that 's a very superior girl \u2014 she has intellect , style , culture \u2014 everything the ideal woman should have . I wonder , now , whether , if I had met her before \u2014 but such speculations are most unprofitable ! How clear her eyes looked through her pince-nez ! Blue-grey , like Athene 's own . If I 'd been with Podbury , I should never have had this talk . The sight of him would have repelled her at once . I shall tell him when I take him that book that he had better go his own way with his new friends . I like the view from this terrace \u2014 I shall come up here again \u2014 often .

Oh , he 'll never get those horses round in .... I was \u2014 er \u2014 rather amused by your evident assumption that I must have been rejected by Miss Prendergast .", "I \u2014 ah \u2014 suppose I have no choice . But you really must allow me to say that it is not precisely the reception I anticipated . Still , in your service , I am willing to endure even Podbury \u2014 for a strictly limited period ; that I do stipulate for .", "Yes , I 've been here some little time . I wish you could have managed to come before , because they close early here to-day , and I wanted to go thoroughly over the tour I sketched out before getting the tickets .", "Quite so . Only , you see , we used to be good friends at", "Pray dismiss such \u2014 er \u2014 morbid misgivings , dear Miss Trotter . Show that you do so by accepting me as your guide and companion through life !", "No \u2014 but we shall be , if we only insist upon being treated seriously .", "Just so . Do you know , Podbury , I almost think I 'll go down and find her . I \u2014 I 'm curious to hear what her impressions of a place like this are . Such a scene , you know ,\u2014 so full of associations with \u2014 er \u2014 the splendours and cruelties of a corrupt past \u2014 must produce a powerful effect upon the fresh untutored mind of an American girl , eh ?", "Podbury , I \u2014 I \u2014 this conversation is evidently not intended for \u2014 for other ears \u2014 I do n't know whether you have heard enough , I shall go down !", "\u201c Figuratively \u201d is a distinct concession on Ruskin 's part .

In future we must keep to our original resolution \u2014 not to be drawn into any chance acquaintanceship . I do n't want to reproach you , but if , when we were first at Brussels , you had not allowed yourself to get so intimate with the Trotters all this would never \u2014\u2014", "What theory ?

You need n't begin right away , Mr. Culchard ; I guess there 's no hurry . But we get talking and talking , and never look at anything .

Whether it happened through a long disuse of writing , that I forgot the usual compass of a play , or that , by crowding it with characters and incidents , I put a necessity upon myself of lengthening the main action , I know not ; but the first day 's audience sufficiently convinced me of my error , and that the poem was insupportably too long . It is an ill ambition of us poets , to please an audience with more than they can bear ; and supposing that we wrote as well as vainly we imagine ourselves to write , yet we ought to consider , that no man can bear to be long tickled . There is a nauseousness in a city-feast , when we are to sit four hours after we are cloyed . I am therefore , in the first place , to acknowledge , with all manner of gratitude , their civility , who were pleased to endure it with so much patience ; to be weary with so much good-nature and silence ; and not to explode an entertainment which was designed to please them , or discourage an author , whose misfortunes have once more brought him , against his will , upon the stage . While I continue in these bad circumstances ,I must be obliged to write ; and if I may still hope for the same kind usage , I shall the less repent of that hard necessity . I write not this out of any expectation to be pitied , for I have enemies enow to wish me yet in a worse condition ; but give me leave to say , that if I can please by writing , as I shall endeavour it , the town may be somewhat obliged to my misfortunes for a part of their diversion . Having been longer acquainted with the stage than any poet now living , and having observed how difficult it was to please ; that the humours of comedy were almost spent ; that love and honourwere quite worn out ; that the theatres could not support their charges ; that the audience forsook them ; that young men , without learning , set up for judges , and that they talked loudest , who understood the least ; all these discouragements had not only weaned me from the stage , but had also given me a loathing of it . But enough of this : the difficulties continue ; they increase ; and I am still condemned to dig in those exhausted mines . Whatever fault I next commit , rest assured it shall not be that of too much length : Above twelve hundred lines have been cut off from this tragedy since it was first delivered to the actors . They were indeed so judiciously lopped by Mr Betterton , to whose care and excellent action I am equally obliged , that the connection of the story was not lost ; but , on the other side , it was impossible to prevent some part of the action from being precipitated , and coming on without that due preparation which is required to all great events : as , in particular , that of raising the mobile , in the beginning of the fourth act , which a man of Benducar 's cool character could not naturally attempt , without taking all those precautions , which he foresaw would be necessary to render his design successful . On this consideration , I have replaced those lines through the whole poem , and thereby restored it to that clearness of conception , andthat lustre and masculine vigour , in which it was first written . It is obvious to every understanding reader , that the most poetical parts , which are descriptions , images , similitudes , and moral sentences , are those which of necessity were to be pared away , when the body was swollen into too large a bulk for the representation of the stage . But there is a vast difference betwixt a public entertainment on the theatre , and a private reading in the closet : In the first , we are confined to time ; and though we talk not by the hour-glass , yet the watch often drawn out of the pocket warns the actors that their audience is weary ; in the last , every reader is judge of his own convenience ; he can take up the book and lay it down at his pleasure , and find out those beauties of propriety in thought and writing , which escaped him in the tumult and hurry of representing . And I dare boldly promise for this play , that in the roughness of the numbers and cadences ,you will see somewhat more masterly arising to your view , than in most , if not any , of my former tragedies . There is a more noble daring in the figures , and more suitable to the loftiness of the subject ; and , besides this , some newnesses of English , translated from the beauties of modern tongues , as well as from the elegancies of the Latin ; and here and there some old words are sprinkled , which , for their significance and sound , deserved not to be antiquated ; such as we often find in Sallust amongst the Roman authors , and in Milton 's \u201c Paradise \u201d amongst ours ; though perhaps the latter , instead of sprinkling , has dealt them with too free a hand , even sometimes to the obscuring of his sense . As for the story , or plot , of the tragedy , it is purely fiction ; for I take it up where the history has laid it down . We are assured by all writers of those times , that Sebastian , a young prince of great courage and expectation , undertook that war , partly upon a religious account , partly at the solicitation of Muley Mahomet , who had been driven out of his dominions by Abdelmelech , or , as others call him , Muley Moluch , his nigh kinsman , who descended from the same family of Xeriffs , whose fathers , Hamet and Mahomet , had conquered that empire with joint forces , and shared it betwixt them after their victory ; that the body of Don Sebastian was never found in the field of battle , which gave occasion for many to believe , that he was not slain; that some years after , when the Spaniards , with a pretended title , by force of arms , had usurped the crown of Portugal from the house of Braganza , a certain person , who called himself Don Sebastian , and had all the marks of his body and features of his face , appeared at Venice , where he was owned by some of his countrymen ; but being seized by the Spaniards , was first imprisoned , then sent to the gallies , and at last put to death in private . It is most certain , that the Portuguese expected his return for almost an age together after that battle , which is at least a proof of their extreme love to his memory ; and the usage they had from their new conquerors , might possibly make them so extravagant in their hopes and wishes for their old masterThis ground-work the history afforded me , and I desire no better to build a play upon ; for where the event of a great action is left doubtful , there the poet is left master . He may raise what he pleases on that foundation , provided he makes it of a piece , and according to the rule of probability . From hence I was only obliged , that Sebastian should return to Portugal no more ; but at the same time I had him at my own disposal , whether to bestow him in Afric , or in any other corner of the world , or to have closed the tragedy with his death ; and the last of these was certainly the most easy , but for the same reason the least artful ; because , as I have somewhere said , the poison and the dagger are still at hand to butcher a hero , when a poet wants the brains to save him . It being therefore only necessary , according to the laws of the drama , that Sebastian should no more be seen upon the throne , I leave it for the world to judge , whether or no I have disposed of him according to art , or have bungled up the conclusion of his adventure . In the drawing of his character , I forgot not piety , which any one may observe to be one principal ingredient of it , even so far as to be a habit in him ; though I shew him once to be transported from it by the violence of a sudden passion , to endeavour a self-murder . This being presupposed , that he was religious , the horror of his incest , though innocently committed , was the best reason which the stage could give for hindering his return . It is true , I have no right to blast his memory with such a crime ; but declaring it to be fiction , I desire my audience to think it no longer true , than while they are seeing it represented ; for that once ended , he may be a saint , for aught I know , and we have reason to presume he is . On this supposition , it was unreasonable to have killed him ; for the learned Mr Rymer has well observed , that in all punishments we are to regulate ourselves by poetical justice ; and according to those measures , an involuntary sin deserves not death ; from whence it follows , that to divorce himself from the beloved object , to retire into a desert , and deprive himself of a throne , was the utmost punishment which a poet could inflict , as it was also the utmost reparation which Sebastian could make . For what relates to Almeyda , her part is wholly fictitious . I know it is the surname of a noble family in Portugal , which was very instrumental in the restoration of Don John de Braganza , father to the most illustrious and most pious princess , our queen-dowager . The French author of a novel , called \u201c Don Sebastian , \u201d has given that name to an African lady of his own invention , and makes her sister to Muley Mahomet ; but I have wholly changed the accidents , and borrowed nothing but the supposition , that she was beloved by the king of Portugal . Though , if I had taken the whole story , and wrought it up into a play , I might have done it exactly according to the practice of almost all the ancients , who were never accused of being plagiaries for building their tragedies on known fables . Thus , Augustus C\u00e6sar wrote an \u201c Ajax , \u201d which was not the less his own , because Euripides had written a play before him on that subject . Thus , of late years , Corneille writ an \u201c OEdipus \u201d after Sophocles ; and I have designed one after him , which I wrote with Mr Lee ; yet neither the French poet stole from the Greek , nor we from the Frenchman . It is the contrivance , the new turn , and new characters , which alter the property , and make it ours . The materia poetica is as common to all writers , as the materia medica to all physicians . Thus , in our Chronicles , Daniel 's history is still his own , though Matthew Paris , Stow , and Hollingshed writ before him ; otherwise we must have been content with their dull relations , if a better pen had not been allowed to come after them , and writ his own account after a new and better manner . I must further declare freely , that I have not exactly kept to the three mechanic rules of unity . I knew them , and had them in my eye , but followed them only at a distance ; for the genius of the English cannot bear too regular a play : we are given to variety , even to a debauchery of pleasure . My scenes are therefore sometimes broken , because my underplot required them so to be , though the general scene remains ,\u2014 of the same castle ; and I have taken the time of two days , because the variety of accidents , which are here represented , could not naturally be supposed to arrive in one : but to gain a greater beauty , it is lawful for a poet to supersede a less . I must likewise own , that I have somewhat deviated from the known history , in the death of Muley Moluch , who , by all relations , died of a fever in the battle , before his army had wholly won the field ; but if I have allowed him another day of life , it was because I stood in need of so shining a character of brutality as I have given him ; which is indeed the same with that of the present emperor Muley-Ishmael , as some of our English officers , who have been in his court , have credibly informed me . I have been listening \u2014 what objections had been made against the conduct of the play ; but found them all so trivial , that if I should name them , a true critic would imagine that I played booty , and only raised up phantoms for myself to conquer . Some are pleased to say \u2014 the writing is dull ; but , \u00e6tatem habet , de se loquatur . Others , that the double poison is unnatural : let the common received opinion , and Ausonius his famous epigram , answer thatLastly , a more ignorant sort of creatures than either of the former maintain , that the character of Dorax is not only unnatural , but inconsistent with itself : let them read the play , and think again ; and if yet they are not satisfied , cast their eyes on that chapter of the wise Montaigne , which is intitled , De l'Inconstance des Actions humaines . A longer reply is what those cavillers deserve not ; but I will give them and their fellows to understand , that the earl of Dorset was pleased to read the tragedy twice over before it was acted , and did me the favour to send me word , that I had written beyond any of my former plays , and that he was displeased any thing should be cut away . If I have not reason to prefer his single judgment to a whole faction , let the world be judge ; for the opposition is the same with that of Lucan 's hero against an army ; concurrere bellum , atque virum . I think I may modestly conclude , that whatever errors there may be , either in the design , or writing of this play , they are not those which have been objected to it . I think also , that I am not yet arrived to the age of doting ; and that I have given so much application to this poem , that I could not probably let it run into many gross absurdities ; which may caution my enemies from too rash a censure , and may also encourage my friends , who are many more than I could reasonably have expected , to believe their kindness has not been very undeservedly bestowed on me . This is not a play that was huddled up in haste ; and , to shew it was not , I will own , that , besides the general moral of it , which is given in the four last lines , there is also another moral , couched under every one of the principal parts and characters , which a judicious critic will observe , though I point not to it in this preface . And there may be also some secret beauties in the decorum of parts , and uniformity of design , which my puny judges will not easily find out : let them consider in the last scene of the fourth act , whether I have not preserved the rule of decency , in giving all the advantage to the royal character , and in making Dorax first submit . Perhaps too they may have thought , that it was through indigence of characters that I have given the same to Sebastian and Almeyda , and consequently made them alike in all things but their sex . But let them look a little deeper into the matter , and they will find , that this identity of character in the greatness of their souls was intended for a preparation of the final discovery , and that the likeness of their nature was a fair hint to the proximity of their blood . To avoid the imputation of too much vanity ,I will give but one other instance , in relation to the uniformity of the design . I have observed , that the English will not bear a thorough tragedy ; but are pleased , that it should be lightened with underparts of mirth . It had been easy for me to have given my audience a better course of comedy , I mean a more diverting , than that of Antonio and Morayma ; but I dare appeal , even to my enemies , if I , or any man , could have invented one , which had been more of a piece , and more depending on the serious part of the design . For what could be more uniform , than to draw from out of the members of a captive court , the subject of a comical entertainment ? To prepare this episode , you see Dorax giving the character of Antonio , in the beginning of the play , upon his first sight of him at the lottery ; and to make the dependence , Antonio is engaged , in the fourth act , for the deliverance of Almeyda ; which is also prepared , by his being first made a slave to the captain of the rabble . I should beg pardon for these instances ; but perhaps they may be of use to future poets , in the conduct of their plays ; at least , if I appear too positive , I am growing old , and thereby in possession of some experience , which men in years will always assume for a right of talking . Certainly if a man can ever have reason to set a value on himself , it is when his ungenerous enemies are taking the advantage of the times upon him , to ruin him in his reputation . And therefore , for once , I will make bold to take the counsel of my old master Virgil , Tu ne cede mails , sed contr\u00e0 audentior ito . Footnotes : 1 . There was a Portuguese prophecy to this purpose , which they applied to the expected return of Sebastian : Vendra et Incubierto , Vendra cierto ; Entrera en el huerto , Per el puerto , Questa mas a ca del muro ; Y'lo que paresce escuro , Se vra claro e abierto .

PROLOGUE SENT TO THE AUTHOR BY AN UNKNOWN HAND , AND PROPOSED TO BE SPOKEN BY MRS MOUNTFORD , DRESSED LIKE AN OFFICERBright beauties , who in awful circle sit , And you , grave synod of the dreadful pit , And you the upper-tire of pop-gun wit , Pray ease me of my wonder , if you may ; Is all this crowd barely to see the play ; Or is't the poet 's execution-day ? His breath is in your hands I will presume , But I advise you to defer his doom , Till you have got a better in his room ; And do n't maliciously combine together , As if in spite and spleen you were come hither ; For he has kept the pen , tho \u2019 lost the featherAnd , on my honour , ladies , I avow , This play was writ in charity to you ; For such a dearth of wit who ever knew ? Sure \u2018 tis a judgment on this sinful nation , For the abuse of so great dispensation ; And , therefore , I resolve to change vocation . For want of petticoat , I 've put on buff , To try what may be got by lying rough : How think you , sirs ? is it not well enough ? Of bully-critics I a troop would lead ; But , one replied ,\u2014 Thank you , there 's no such need , I at Groom-Porter 's , sir , can safer bleed . Another , who the name of danger loaths , Vow 'd he would go , and swore me forty oaths , But that his horses were in body-clothes . A third cried ,\u2014 Damn my blood , I 'll be content To push my fortune , if the parliament Would but recal claret from banishment . A fourthmade this excuse \u2014 I 'd draw my sword in Ireland , sir , to chuse ; Had not their women gouty legs , and wore no shoes . Well , I may march , thought I , and fight , and trudge , But , of these blades , the devil a man will budge ; They there would fight , e'en just as here they judge . Here they will pay for leave to find a fault ; But , when their honour calls , they can n't be bought ; Honour in danger , blood , and wounds is sought . Lost virtue , whither fled ? or where 's thy dwelling Who can reveal ? at least , \u2018 tis past my telling , Unless thou art embarked for Inniskilling . On carrion-tits those sparks denounce their rage , In boot of wisp and Leinster frise engage ; What would you do in such an equipage? The siege of Derry does you gallants threaten ; Not out of errant shame of being beaten , As fear of wanting meat , or being eaten . Were wit like honour , to be won by fighting , How few just judges would there be of writing ! Then you would leave this villainous back-biting . Your talents lie how to express your spite ; But , where is he who knows to praise aright ? You praise like cowards , but like critics fight . Ladies , be wise , and wean these yearling calves , Who , in your service too , are meer faux braves ; They judge , and write , and fight , and love \u2014 by halves . Footnotes : 1 . The humour of this intended prologue turns upon the unwillingness displayed to attend King William into Ireland by many of the nobility and gentry , who had taken arms at the Revolution . The truth is , that , though invited to go as volunteers , they could not but consider themselves as hostages , of whom William did not chuse to lose sight , lest , while he was conquering Ireland , he might , perchance , lose England , by means of the very men by whom he had won it . The disbanding of the royal regiment had furnished a subject for the satirical wit of Buckingham , at least , such a piece is printed in his Miscellanies ; and for that of Shadwell , in his epilogue to Bury-fair . But Shadwell was now poet-laureat , and his satire was privileged , like the wit of the ancient royal jester . Our author was suspected of disaffection , and liable to misconstruction : For which reason , probably , he declined this sarcastic prologue , and substituted that which follows , the tone of which is submissive , and conciliatory towards the government . Contrary to custom , it was spoken by a woman .", "The Inniskilling horse , who behaved with great courage against King James , joined Schomberg and King William 's forces at Dundalk , in 1689 , rather resembled a foreign frey-corps , than regular troops . \u201c They were followed by multitudes of their women ; they were uncouth in their appearance ; they rode on small horses , called Garrons ; their pistols were not fixed in holsters , but dangled about their persons , being slung to their sword-belts ; they offered , with spirit , to make always the forlorn of the army ; but , upon the first order they received , they cried out , \u2018 They could thrive no longer , since they were now put under orders . \u2019 \u2014 Memoirs , Vol .

Jove was alike to Latian and to Phrygian ; And you well know , a play 's of no religion . Take good advice , and please yourselves this day ; No matter from what hands you have the play . Among good fellows every health will pass , That serves to carry round another glass : When with full bowls of Burgundy you dine , } Though at the mighty monarch you repine , } You grant him still Most Christian in his wine . } Thus far the poet ; but his brains grow addle , And all the rest is purely from this noddle . You have seen young ladies at the senate-door , Prefer petitions , and your grace implore ; However grave the legislators were , Their cause went ne'er the worse for being fair . Reasons as weak as theirs , perhaps , I bring ; But I could bribe you with as good a thing . I heard him make advances of good nature ; That he , for once , would sheath his cutting satire . Sign but his peace , he vows he 'll ne'er again The sacred names of fops and beaus profane . Strike up the bargain quickly ; for I swear , As times go now , he offers very fair . Be not too hard on him with statutes neither ; } Be kind ; and do not set your teeth together , } To stretch the laws , as coblers do their leather . } Horses by Papists are not to be ridden , But sure the muses \u2019 horse was ne'er forbidden ; For in no rate-book it was ever found That Pegasus was valued at five poundFine him to daily drudging and inditing : And let him pay his taxes out in writing .

The curtain rises , and a new frontispiece is seen , joined to the great pilasters , which are seen on each side of the stage : on the flat of each basis is a shield , adorned with gold ; in the middle of the shield , on one side , are two hearts , a small scroll of gold over them , and an imperial crown over the scroll ; on the other hand , in the shield , are two quivers full of arrows saltyre , & c .; upon each basis stands a figure bigger than the life ; one represents Peace , with a palm in one , and an olive branch in the other hand ; the other Plenty , holding a cornucopia , and resting on a pillar . Behind these figures are large columns of the Corinthian order , adorned with fruit and flowers : over one of the figures on the trees is the king 's cypher ; over the other , the queen 's : over the capitals , on the cornice , sits a figure on each side ; one represents Poetry , crowned with laurel , holding a scroll in one hand , the other with a pen in it , and resting on a book ; the other , Painting , with a pallet and pencils , & c .: on the sweep of the arch lies one of the Muses , playing on a bass-viol ; another of the Muses , on the other side , holding a trumpet in one hand , and the other on a harp . Between these figures , in the middle of the sweep of the arch , is a very large pannel in a frame of gold ; in this pannel is painted , on one side , a Woman , representing the city of London , leaning her head on her hand in a dejected posture , showing her sorrow and penitence for her offences ; the other hand holds the arms of the city , and a mace lying under it : on the other side is a figure of the Thames , with his legs shackled , and leaning on an empty urn : behind these are two imperial figures ; one representing his present majesty ; and the other the queen : by the king stands Pallas ,holding a charter for the city , the king extending his hand , as raising her drooping head , and restoring her to her ancient honour and glory : over the city are the envious devouring Harpies flying from the face of his majesty : By the queen stand the Three Graces , holding garlands of flowers , and at her feet Cupids bound , with their bows and arrows broken , the queen pointing with her sceptre to the river , and commanding the Graces to take off their fetters . Over the king , in a scroll , is this verse of Virgil , Discite justitiam , moniti , et non temnere divos . Over the queen , this of the same author , Non ignara mali , miscris succurrere disco .

But Dryden seems obviously to talk of the author of the Defence , and the two Reflectors , as three separate persons .

In the year of his majesty 's happy Restoration , the first play I undertook was the \u201c Duke of Guise ; \u201d as the fairest way , which the Act of Indemnity had then left us , of setting forth the rise of the late rebellion ; and by exploding the villainies of it upon the stage , to precaution posterity against the like errors . As this was my first essay , so it met with the fortune of an unfinished piece ; that is to say , it was damned in private , by the advice of some friends to whom I shewed it ; who freely told me , that it was an excellent subject ; but not so artificially wrought , as they could have wished ; and now let my enemies make their best of this confession . The scene of the Duke of Guise 's return to Paris , against the king 's positive command , was then written . I have the copy of it still by me , almost the same which it now remains , being taken verbatim out of Davila ; for where the action is remarkable , and the very words related , the poet is not at liberty to change them much ; and if he will be adding any thing for ornament , it ought to be wholly of a piece . This do I take for a sufficient justification of that scene , unless they will make the pretended parallel to be a prophecy , as well as a parallel of accidents , that were twenty years after to come .Neither do I find , that they can suggest the least colour for it in any other part of the tragedy . But now comes the main objection ,\u2014 why was it stopt then ? To which I shall render this just account , with all due respects to those who were the occasion of it . Upon a wandering rumourthat some great persons were represented , or personated in it , the matter was complained of to my Lord Chamberlain ; who , thereupon , appointed the play to be brought to him , and prohibited the acting of it until further order ; commanding me , after this , to wait upon his lordship ; which I did , and humbly desired him to compare the play with the history , from whence the subject was taken , referring to the first scene of the fourth act , whereupon the exception was grounded , and leaving Davilawith his lordship . This was before midsummer ; and about two months after , I received the play back again from his lordship , but without any positive order whether it should be acted or not ; neither was Mr Lee , or myself , any way solicitous about it . But this indeed I ever said , that it was intended for the king 's service ; and his majesty was the best judge , whether it answered that end or no ; and that I reckoned it my duty to submit , if his majesty , for any reason whatsoever , should deem it unfit for the stage . In the interim , a strict scrutiny was made , and no parallel of the great person designed , could be made out . But this push failing , there were immediately started some terrible insinuations , that the person of his majesty was represented under that of Henry the Third ; which if they could have found out , would have concluded , perchance , not only in the stopping of the play , but in the hanging up of the poets . But so it was , that his majesty 's wisdom and justice acquitted both the one , and the other ; and when the play itself was almost forgotten , there were orders given for the acting of it . This is matter of fact ; and I have the honour of so great witnesses to the truth of what I have delivered , that it will need no other appeal . As to the exposing of any person living , our innocency is so clear , that it is almost unnecessary to say , it was not in my thought ; and , as far as any one man can vouch for another , I do believe it was as little in Mr Lee 's . And now since some people have been so busy as to cast out false and scandalous surmises , how far we two agreed upon the writing of it , I must do a common right both to Mr Lee and myself , to declare publicly , that it was at his earnest desire , without any solicitation of mine , that this play was produced betwixt us . After the writing of OEdipus , I passed a promise to join with him in another ; and he happened to claim the performance of that promise , just upon the finishing of a poem ,when I would have been glad of a little respite before the undertaking of a second task . The person , that passed betwixt us , knows this to be true ; and Mr Lee himself , I am sure , will not disown it ; So that I did not \u201c seduce him to join with me , \u201d as the malicious authors of the Reflections are pleased to call it ; but Mr Lee 's loyalty is above so ridiculous a slander . I know very well , that the town did ignorantly call and take this to be my play ; but I shall not arrogate to myself the merits of my friend . Two-thirds of it belonged to him ; and to me only the first scene of the play ; the whole fourth act , and the first half , or somewhat more , of the fifth . The pamphleteers , I know , do very boldly insinuate , that , \u201c before the acting of it , I took the whole play to myself ; but finding afterwards how ill success it had upon the stage , I threw as much of it as possibly I could upon my fellow . \u201d Now here are three damned lies crowded together into a very little room ; first , that I assumed any part of it to myself , which I had not written ; wherein I appeal , not only to my particular acquaintance , but to the whole company of actors , who will witness for me , that , in all the rehearsals , I never pretended to any one scene of Mr Lee 's , but did him all imaginable right , in his title to the greater part of it . I hope I may , without vanity , affirm to the world , that I never stood in need of borrowing another man 's reputation ; and I have been as little guilty of the injustice , of laying claim to any thing which was not my own . Nay , I durst almost refer myself to some of the angry poets on the other side , whether I have not rather countenanced and assisted their beginnings , than hindered them from rising .The two other falsities are , the \u201c ill success of the play , \u201d and \u201c my disowning it . \u201d The former is manifestly without foundation ; for it succeeded beyond my very hopes , having been frequently acted , and never without a considerable audience ; and then it is a thousand to one , that , having no ground to disown it , I did not disown it ; but the universe to a nutshell that I did not disown it for want of success , when it succeeded so much beyond my expectation . But my malignant adversaries are the more excusable for this coarse method of breaking in upon truth and good manners , because it is the only way they have to gratify the genius and the interest of the faction together ; and never so much pains taken neither , to so very , very little purpose . They decry the play , but in such a manner , that it has the effect of a recommendation . They call it \u201c a dull entertainment ; \u201d and that is a dangerous word , I must confess , from one of the greatest masters in human nature , of that faculty . Now I can forgive them this reproach too , after all the rest ; for this play does openly discover the original and root of the practices and principles , both of their party and cause ; and they are so well acquainted with all the trains and mazes of rebellion , that there is nothing new to them in the whole history . Or what if it were a little insipid , there was no conjuring that I remember in \u201c Pope Joan ; \u201d and the \u201c Lancashire Witches \u201d were without doubt the most insipid jades that ever flew upon a stage ; and even these , by the favour of a party , made a shift to hold up their heads .Now , if we have out-done these plays in their own dull way , their authors have some sort of privilege to throw the first stone ; but we shall rather chuse to yield the point of dulness , than contend for it , against so indisputable a claim . But \u201c matters of stateare canvassed on the stage , and things of the gravest concernment there managed ; \u201d and who were the aggressors , I beseech you , but a few factious , popular hirelings , that by tampering the theatres , and by poisoning the people , made a play-house more seditious than a conventicle ; so that the loyal party crave only the same freedom of defending the government , which the other took beforehand of exposing and defaming it . There was no complaint of any disorders of the stage , in the bustle that was madeto uphold a farce of theirs .Upon the first day , the whole factionappeared ; but after one sight of it , they sent their proxies of serving-men and porters , to clap in the right of their patrons ; and it was impossible ever to have gotten off the nonsense of three hours for half-a-crown , but for the providence of so congruous an audience . Thus far , I presume , the reckoning is even , for bad plays on both sides , and for plays written for a party . I shall say nothing of their poets \u2019 affection to the government ; unless upon an absolute and an odious necessity . But to return to the pretended Parallel . I have said enough already to convince any man of common sense , that there neither was , nor could be , any Parallel intended ; and it will farther appear , from the nature of the subject ; there being no relation betwixt Henry the Third and the Duke of Guise , except that of the king 's marrying into the family of Lorraine . If a comparison had been designed , how easy had it been either to have found a story , or to have invented one , where the ties of nature had been nearer ? If we consider their actions , or their persons , a much less proportion will be yet found betwixt them ; and if we bate the popularity , perhaps none at all . If we consider them in reference to their parties , the one was manifestly the leader ; the other , at the worst , is but misled . The designs of the one tended openly to usurpation ; those of the other may yet be interpreted more fairly ; and I hope , from the natural candour and probity of his temper , that it will come to a perfect submission and reconcilement at last . But that which perfectly destroys this pretended Parallel is , that our picture of the Duke of Guise is exactly according to the original in the history ; his actions , his manners , nay , sometimes his very words , are so justly copied , that whoever has read him in Davila , sees him the same here . There is no going out of the way , no dash of a pen to make any by-feature resemble him to any other man ; and indeed , excepting his ambition , there was not in France , or perhaps in any other country , any man of his age vain enough to hope he could be mistaken for him .So that if you would have made a Parallel , we could not . And yet I fancy , that where I make it my business to draw likeness , it will be no hard matter to judge who sate for the picture . For the Duke of Guise 's return to Paris contrary to the king 's order , enough already has been said ; it was too considerable in the story to be omitted , because it occasioned the mischiefs that ensued . But in this likeness , which was only casual , no danger followed . I am confident there was none intended ; and am satisfied that none was feared . But the argument drawn from our evident design is yet , if possible , more convincing . The first words of the prologue spake the play to be a Parallel , and then you are immediately informed how far that Parallel extended , and of what it is so : \u201c The Holy League begot the Covenant , Guisards got the Whig , & c . \u201d So then it is not ,a Parallel of the men , but of the times ; a Parallel of the factions , and of the leaguers . And every one knows that this prologue was written before the stopping of the play . Neither was the name altered on any such account as they insinuate , but laid aside long before , because a book called the Parallel had been printed , resembling the French League to the English Covenant ; and therefore we thought it not convenient to make use of another man 's title .The chief person in the tragedy , or he whose disasters are the subject of it , may in reason give the name ; and so it was called the \u201c Duke of Guise . \u201d Our intention therefore was to make the play a Parallel betwixt the Holy League , plotted by the house of Guise and its adherents , with the Covenant plotted by the rebels in the time of king Charles I. and those of the new Association , which was the spawn of the old Covenant . But this parallel is plain , that the exclusion of the lawful heir was the main design of both parties ; and that the endeavours to get the lieutenancy of France established on the head of the League , is in effect the same with offering to get the militia out of the king 's handand consequently , that the power of peace and war should be wholly in the people . It is also true that the tumults in the city , in the choice of their officers , have had no small resemblance with a Parisian rabble : and I am afraid that both their faction and ours had the same good lord . I believe also , that if Julian had been written and calculated for the Parisians , as it was for our sectaries , one of their sheriffs might have mistaken too , and called him Julian the Apostle .I suppose I need not push this point any further ; where the parallel was intended , I am certain it will reach ; but a larger account of the proceedings in the city may be expected from a better hand , and I have no reason to forestall it .In the mean time , because there has been no actual rebellion , the faction triumph in their loyalty ; which if it were out of principle , all our divisions would soon be ended , and we the happy people , which God and the constitution of our government have put us in condition to be ; but so long as they take it for a maxim , that the king is but an officer in trust , that the people , or their representatives , are superior to him , judges of miscarriages , and have power of revocation , it is a plain case , that whenever they please they may take up arms ; and , according to their doctrine , lawfully too . Let them jointly renounce this one opinion , as in conscience and law they are bound to do , because both scripture and acts of parliament oblige them to it , and we will then thank their obedience for our quiet , whereas now we are only beholden to them for their fear . The miseries of the last war are yet too fresh in all men 's memory ; and they are not rebels , only because they have been so too lately . An author of theirs has told us roundly the west-country proverb ; Chud eat more cheese , and chad it ; their stomach is as good as ever it was ; but the mischief o n't is , they are either muzzled , or want their teeth . If there were as many fanatics now in England , as there were christians in the empire , when Julian reigned , I doubt we should not find them much inclined to passive obedience ; and , \u201c Curse ye Meroz \u201dwould be oftener preached upon , than \u201c Give to C\u00e6sar , \u201d except in the sense Mr Hunt means it . Having clearly shewn wherein the parallel consisted , which no man can mistake , who does not wilfully , I need not justify myself , in what concerns the sacred person of his majesty . Neither the French history , nor our own , could have supplied me , nor Plutarch himself , were he now alive , could have found a Greek or Roman to have compared to him , in that eminent virtue of his clemency ; even his enemies must acknowledge it to be superlative , because they live by it . Far be it from flattery , if I say , that there is nothing under heaven , which can furnish me with a parallel ; and that , in his mercy , he is of all men the truest image of his Maker .", "For , interpreter ; more usually spelled dragoman ."]}, "act_index": 28, "play_index": 28}, {"data": {"766": ["The atrocious and blasphemous sentiment in the text was actually used by the fanatics who murdered Sharpe , the archbishop of St Andrews .

In enumerating the persons engaged in the Rye-house plot , he mentions \u201c Richard Rumbold , maltster , an old army officer , a desperate and bloody Ravaillac . \u201d After agitating several schemes for assassinating Charles , the Rye-house was fixed upon as a spot which the king must necessarily pass in his journey trom Newmarket , and which , being a solitary moated house , in the actual occupation of Rumbold , afforded the conspirators facility of previous concealment and subsequent defence . \u201c All other propositions , as subject to far more casualties and hazards , soon gave place to that of the Rye , in Herefordshire , a house then inhabited by the foresaid Richard Rumbold , who proposed that to be the seat of the action , offering himself to command the party , that was to do the work . Him , therefore , as the most daring captain , and by reason of a blemish in one of his eyes , they were afterwards wont , in common discourse , to call Hannibal ; often drinking healths to Hannibal and his boys , meaning Rumbold and his hellish crew . \u201c Immediately upon the coaches coming within the gates and hedges about the house , the conspirators were to divide into several parties ; some before , in the habit of labourers , were to overthrow a cart in the narrowest passage , so as to prevent all possibility of escape : others were to fight the guards , Walcot chusing that part upon a punctilio of honour ; others were to shoot at the coachman , postillion , and horses ; others to aim only at his Majesty 's coach , which party was to be under the particular direction of Rumbold himself ; the villain declaring beforehand , that , upon that occasion , he would make use of a very good blunderbuss , which was in West 's possession , and blasphemously adding , that Ferguson should first consecrate it . \u201d ... \u201c But whilst they were thus wholly intent on this barbarous work , and proceeded securely in its contrivance without any the least doubt of a prosperous success , behold ! on a sudden , God miraculously disappointed all their hopes and designs , by the terrible conflagration unexpectedly breaking out at Newmarket . In which extraordinary event there was one remarkable passage , that is not so generally taken notice of , as , for the glory of God , and the confusion of his Majesty 's enemies , it ought to be . \u201c For , after that the approaching fury of the flames had driven the king out of his own palace , his Majesty , at first , removed into another quarter of the town , remote from the fire , and , as yet , free from any annoyance of smoke and ashes .

But his Majesty had no sooner made that resolution , when the wind , as conducted by an invisible power from above , presently changed about , and blew the smoke and cinders directly on his new lodging , making them in a moment as untenable as the other . Upon this , his Majesty being put to a new shift , and not finding the like conveniency elsewhere , immediately declared , he would speedily return to Whitehall , as he did ; which happening to be several days before the assassins expected him , or their preparations for the Rye were in readiness , it may justly give occasion to all the world to acknowledge , what one of the very conspirators could not but do , that it was a providential fire . \u201d \u2014 Pages 51 et seq .

Andavan le grida del popolo insino al cielo , n\u00e8 mai fu con tanto plauso gridato , \u201c Vita il Re \u201d con quanto ora si gridava \u201c Vita Guisa . \u201d Chi lo sulutava , chi lo ringraziava , chi se gl \u2019 inchinava , chi gli baciava le falde de \u2019 vestimenti , chi , non potendo accostarsi , con le mani e con i gesti di tutto il corpo dava segui profusi d \u2019 allegrezza ; e furono veduti di quelli che , adorandolo come santo , lo toccavano con le corone , e le medesime poi o baciavano , o con esse si toccavano gli occhi e la fronte ; e sino le donne dalle finestra , spargendo fiori e fronde , onoravano e benedicevano la sua venuta . Egli all \u2019 incontro , con viso popolare e con faccia ridente , altri accarezzava con le parole , altri risalutava con i gesti , altri rallegrava con l \u2019 occhio , e traversando le caterve del popolo con la testa scoperta , non permetteva cosa alcuna , che fosse a proposito per finire a conciliarsi la benevolenza e l \u2019 applauso popolare . In questa maniera , senza fermarsi alla sua casa , and\u00f2 a dirittura a smontare a Sant \u2019 Eustachio al palazzo della Reina Madre , la quale mezza attonita per il suo venire improvviso ; perch\u00e8 Monsignor di Bellieure arrivato tre ore innanzi aveva posto in dubbio la sua venuta ; lo ricev\u00e8 pallida nel volto , tutta tremante e contra l \u2019 ordinario costume della natura sua quasi smarrita .

La Reina , interrotto il ragionamento , mentre egli salutava , come \u00e8 solito , le altre Dame della corte , chiam\u00f2 Luigi Davila suo Gentiluomo d \u2019 onore , e gli commise , che facesse intendere al Re , ch \u2019 era arrivato il Duca di Guisa , e ch \u2019 ella fra poco l \u2019 arebbe condotto al Lovero personalmente . Si commosse di maniera il Re , ch \u2019 era nel suo gabinetto con Monsignore di Villaclera , con Bellieure e con l \u2019 abbate del Bene , che fu costretto appogiarsi col braccio , coprendosi la faccia , al tavolino , e interrogato il Davila d \u2019 ogni particolare , gli command\u00f2 , che dicesse segretamente alla Reina , che framettesse pi\u00f9 tempo che fosse possibile alla venuta . L \u2019 Abbate del Bene e il Colonello Alfonso Corso , il quale entr\u00f2 in questo punto nel gabinetto , e era confidentissimo , servitore del Re , e pieno di merito verso la corona , lo consigliavano , che ricevendo il Duca di Guisa nel medesimo gabinetto , lo facese uccidere subito nell \u2019 istesso luogo , dicendo l \u2019 abbate questo Percutiam pastorem , et dispergentur oves .

But upon occasion of the signal of a green ribbon , agreed to be worn in their hats in the days of secret engagements , like the coats of arms of valiant knights of old , whereby all the warriors of the society might be distinguished , and not mistake friends for enemies , they were called also the Green Ribbon Club . Their seat was in a sort of carrefour , at Chancery-Lane end , a centre of business and company , most proper for such anglers of fools . The house was double-balconied in front , as may be yet seen , for the clubsters to issue forth , in fresco , with hats and no peruques , pipes in their mouths , merry faces , and diluted throats , for vocal encouragement of the canaglia below , at bonfires , on usual and unusual occasions .

They took no single aim :\u2014 But , like bold boys , true to their prince , and hearty , Huzza 'd , and fired broadsides at the whole party . Duels are crimes ; but , when the cause is right , In battle every man is bound to fight . For what should hinder me to sell my skin , } Dear as I could , if once my hand were in ? } Se defendendo never was a sin . } \u2018 Tis a fine world , my masters ! right or wrong , The Whigs must talk , and Tories hold their tongue . They must do all they can , But we , forsooth , must bear a christian mind ; And fight , like boys , with one hand tied behind ; Nay , and when one boy 's down , \u2018 twere wond'rous wise , To cry ,\u2014 box fair , and give him time to rise . When fortune favours , none but fools will dally ; } Would any of you sparks , if Nan , or Mally , } Tip you the inviting wink , stand , shall I , shall I ? } A Trimmer cried ,Fie , mistress Cook , \u2018 faith you 're too rank a Tory !

These illustrations are designedly selected from the parts of the lower characters , because they at once evince the diligence and success with which Dryden has laboured even the subordinate points of this tragedy . \u201c Don Sebastian \u201d has been weighed , with reference to its tragic merits , against \u201c Love for Love ; \u201d and one or other is universally allowed to be the first of Dryden 's dramatic performances . To the youth of both sexes the latter presents the most pleasing subject of emotion ; but to those whom age has rendered incredulous upon the romantic effects of love , and who do not fear to look into the recesses of the human heart , when agitated by darker and more stubborn passions , \u201c Don Sebastian \u201d offers a far superior source of gratification . To point out the blemishes of so beautiful a tragedy , is a painful , though a necessary , task . The style , here and there , exhibits marks of a reviving taste for those frantic bursts of passion , which our author has himself termed the \u201c Dalilahs of the theatre . \u201d The first speech of Sebastian has been often noticed as an extravagant rant , more worthy of Maximin , or Almanzor , than of a character drawn by our author in his advanced years , and chastened taste : I beg no pity for this mouldering clay ; For if you give it burial , there it takes Possession of your earth : If burnt and scatter 'd in the air , the winds , That strew my dust , diffuse my royalty , And spread me o'er your clime ; for where one atom Of mine shall light , know , there Sebastian reigns . The reader 's discernment will discover some similar extravagancies in the language of Almeyda and the Emperor . It is a separate objection , that the manners of the age and country are not adhered to . Sebastian , by disposition a crusading knight-errant , devoted to religion and chivalry , becomes , in the hands of Dryden , merely a gallant soldier and high-spirited prince , such as existed in the poet 's own days . But , what is worse , the manners of Mahometans are shockingly violated . Who ever heard of human sacrifices , or of any sacrifices , being offered up to Mahomet; and when were his followers able to use the classical and learned allusions which occur throughout the dialogue ! On this last topic Addison makes the following observations , in the \u201c Guardian , \u201d No . 110 . \u201c I have now Mr Dryden 's \u201c Don Sebastian \u201d before me , in which I find frequent allusions to ancient poetry , and the old mythology of the heathens . It is not very natural to suppose a king of Portugal would be borrowing thoughts out of Ovid 's \u201c Metamorphoses , \u201d when he talked even to those of his own court ; but to allude to these Roman fables , when he talks to an emperor of Barbary , seems very extraordinary . But observe how he defies him out of the classics in the following lines : Why didst not thou engage me man to man , And try the virtue of that Gorgon face , To stare me into statue ? \u201c Almeyda , at the same time , is more book-learned than Don Sebastian . She plays an Hydra upon the Emperor , that is full as good as the Gorgon : O that I had the fruitful heads of Hydra , That one might bourgeon where another fell ! Still would I give thee work , still , still , thou tyrant , And hiss thee with the last . \u201c She afterwards , in allusion to Hercules , bids him \u2018 lay down the lion 's skin , and take the distaff ; \u2019 and , in the following speech , utters her passion still more learnedly : No ; were we joined , even though it were in death , Our bodies burning in one funeral pile , The prodigy of Thebes would be renewed , And my divided flame should break from thine . \u201c The emperor of Barbary shews himself acquainted with the Roman poets as well as either of his prisoners , and answers the foregoing speech in the same classic strain : Serpent , I will engender poison with thee : Our offspring , like the seed of dragon 's teeth , Shall issue armed , and fight themselves to death . \u201c Ovid seems to have been Muley-Moloch 's favourite author ; witness the lines that follow : She , still inexorable , still imperious , And loud , as if , like Bacchus , born in thunder . \u201c I shall conclude my remarks on his part with that poetical complaint of his being in love ; and leave my reader to consider , how prettily it would sound in the mouth of an emperor of Morocco : The god of love once more has shot his fires Into my soul , and my whole heart receives him . \u201c Muley Zeydan is as ingenious a man as his brother Muley Moloch ; as where he hints at the story of Castor and Pollux : May we ne'er meet ; For , like the twins of Leda , when I mount , He gallops down the skies . \u201c As for the Mufti , we will suppose that he was bred up a scholar , and not only versed in the law of Mahomet , but acquainted with all kinds of polite learning . For this reason he is not at all surprised when Dorax calls him a Ph\u00e6ton in one place , and in another tells him he is like Archimedes . \u201c The Mufti afterwards mentions Ximenes , Albornoz , and cardinal Wolsey , by name . The poet seems to think , he may make every person , in his play , know as much as himself , and talk as well as he could have done on the same occasion . At least , I believe , every reader will agree with me , that the above-mentioned sentiments , to which I might have added several others , would have been better suited to the court of Augustus than that of Muley Moloch . I grant they are beautiful in themselves , and much more so in that noble language , which was peculiar to this great poet . I only observe , that they are improper for the persons who make use of them . \u201d The catastrophe of the tragedy may be also censured , not only on the grounds objected to that of \u201c OEdipus , \u201d but because it does not naturally flow from the preceding events , and opens , in the fifth act , a new set of persons , and a train of circumstances , unconnected with the preceding action . In the concluding scene , it was remarked , by the critics , that there is a want of pure taste in the lovers dwelling more upon the pleasures than the horrors of their incestuous connection . Of the lighter scenes , which were intended for comic , Dr Johnson has said , \u201c they are such as that age did not probably commend , and as the present would not endure . \u201d Dryden has remarked , with self-complacency , the art with which they are made to depend upon the serious business . This has not , however , the merit of novelty ; being not unlike the connection between the tragic and comic scenes of the \u201c Spanish Friar . \u201d The persons introduced have also some resemblance ; though the gaiety of Antonio is far more gross than that of Lorenzo , and Morayma is a very poor copy of Elvira . It is rather surprising , that when a gay libertine was to be introduced , Dryden did not avail himself of a real character , the English Stukely ; a wild gallant , who , after spending a noble fortune , became the leader of a band of Italian Condottieri , engaged in the service of Sebastian , and actually fell in the battle of Alcazar . Collier complains , and with very good reason , that , in the character of the Mufti , Dryden has seized an opportunity to deride and calumniate the priesthood of every religion ; an opportunity which , I am sorry to say , he seldom fails to use with unjustifiable inveteracy . The rabble scenes were probably given , as our author himself says of that in Cleomenes , \u201c to gratify the more barbarous part of the audience . \u201d Indeed , to judge from the practice of the drama at this time , the representation of a riot upon the stage seems to have had the same charms for the popular part of the English audience , which its reality always possesses in the streets . Notwithstanding the excellence of this tragedy , it appears to have been endured , rather than applauded , at its first representation ; although , being judiciously curtailed , it soon became a great favourite with the public; and , omitting the comic scenes , may be again brought forward with advantage , when the public shall be tired of children and of show . The tragedy of \u201c Don Sebastian \u201d was acted and printed in 1690 .

Baker thinks Dryden might have taken the hint of \u201c Don Sebastian \u201d from this old play .
